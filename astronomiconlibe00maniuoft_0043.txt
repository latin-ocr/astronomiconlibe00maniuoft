NOTE ΟΝ THE MADRID MS.

Thebais nor Achilleis was ever found conjoined in one volume
with Silius. And since this Catalogue comes from the-neighbour-
hood of Constance‚ and since M, which once conjoined Silius and
Siluae, has its origin in the same neighbourhood, Ι have no doubt
that in ‘ Sili et Stacii uolumen ⁷ the reference is to the Siluae.

Was-the volume, then, to which this Catalogue refers, the actual
MS. of Siluae and Silius discovered by Poggio (or Bartolomeo) in
1416? Ι am inclined to think that it was not, and that the real
importance of the Catalogue consists in the evidence it furnishes
that siluae and Silius were known in saec. ix, in the region where
Poggio in saec. xv discovered, as is supposed, the parent of M.
1 arn unwilling to identify the MSS. of this Catalogue with the
parent of M for the reason that I believe the parent of M to have
contained, as M does, Manilius as well as the Silvae (and Silius).
The reasons for this belief Ι have already given.¹

APPENDIX ΙΙ

MANILIUS IN SCALloER’s CORRESPONDENCE.

Most of the references to Manilius which are to be found in
< Scaliger's Letters, or in those of his correspondents, occur scattered
up and down the pages of my Introductions. None of the conec<
tions of Letters from which they are drawn have Indices save
Burmann and de Larroque. Burmann’s Indices are quite in-
adequate; and one or two references have escaped de Larroque.
It will perhaps be of interest, therefore, to students of Manilius—
or of Scaliger—to have before them in one place all the references
which I have been here able to collect. Some will no doubt have
escaped me3 but not, I think, many. Ι arrange these references
so far as possible in chronological order.
