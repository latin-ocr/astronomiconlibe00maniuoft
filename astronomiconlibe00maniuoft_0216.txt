H.ffl346 COMMENTARY

Mommsen, but will allow only of a Chaldean source for Eudoxus.
Besides Mommsen and Boll see Bouche-Leclercq, pp. 182 sqq.
.. 433. his animaduersis: lzz's am'mum aduersis, Verg. Georg. ii. 259,
ιιι. 123.

debes: rebus MSS.; retained by Scaliger, Du Fay, &Q who
seem to take the construction as quae proxima cura est ea est cura
noscendi. So stoeben if 1 understand him. But Bentley justly says,
noscere m'lzz'l habel quocum in. conslructione iungatur. Bonincon-
trius‚ Jacob, Bechert, Breiter think to remove Bentley’s objection by
placing a note of interrogation at cura. Their grammar is thus better
than Scaliger‘s, but their feeling for Latin worse. Bentley's restat is
palaeographically weak. My debes is a small change and yields the
required sense. Prof. D. A. Slater takes cura as pres. imper. of verb
curo, and quae proxima as = τὰ proxima: the infin. noscere will then
be dependent on cura. This ingenious suggestion is new and, 1 think,
attractive.

435. Breiter rightly sees here a reference to the Stoic doctrine that
the gods are personifications os the virtues3 cf. Schmekel,.=1liddle
Stoa, p. 243. For a different view see Cramer.

438. pondus . . . persona: rather differently Prudentius Symm.
ii. 646 mentitumque grauis personae inducere pondus.

439. Lanigerum: Pallas is lanifica; cf. Servius Aen. ii. 259.

Taurum: Taurus is diues puellis (iv, 519) ; habitatque puer sub
fronte Cupido (iv. 151); see n. on 153.

440. formosos Phoebus Geminos: because formosos. The iden—
tification of the Twins as either Apollo and Hercules, or Apollo and
Bacchus, is hardly in point here, despite Bouche-Leclercq, p. 184.

Cyllenie Cancrum ε propter Cancri testudinem.

441. The Lion is, of course, peculiarly associated with the Magna
Mater: Catull. lxii; here with Jupiter partly, perhaps, because he is
pater deum, partly, and rather, because the Lion is βασιλίσκος and
from him come βασιλικὰ γένεθλα.

tuque paler for Iuppiter et, Bentley, with some probability.

442. spicifer: the word is not earlier than Manilius ; cf. Inscr. Orell.
5863; carm. Engr. (Bucheler) i. 24, where Virgo is called spz'cisera,
iusti inuenttix, urbium conditrix3 Sen. H. Oet. 598 spica-'fera dea (of
Ceres).

Cereris : propter spicas.
fabricataque Libra Vulcani: Libra quippe fabri opus est, Vul-
canus uero de07‘umfaberfuz‘t, Du Fay.

443. Mauorti Scorpios ι propterea quodpugnax.

444. uenantem Diana uirum sed partis equinae : ‘the huntsman
that is half horse'3 cf. i. 409 pars hominis, tergo pectus comms'ssus
equum.

445. angusta: (cf. i. 271) ‘cramped', or even ‘shrarnmed'—the
epitlget belongs properly to Capricorn who is gelu contractus in astris
(252.

Vesta: the deity of winter fires.

446. ‘Aquarius, opposite Jove, is Juno's sign ἐ ex Iouis aduerso.
apparently sor ‘opposite Jove’s sign ', i.e. opposite Leo 3—Le0 and
Aquarius are contraria. The MSS. have el Ionis aduerso, which
Breiter calls ‘zulassig’. Bonincontrius reads et louis (sub. astro)
aduersum ; so too Ellis. The rainy sign, Aquarius, belongs to Juno as
goddess of the atmosphere. For Juno as a personification of the
atmosphere see Heinze Vmgil’s Episclze Teclzm'kl, p. 292, ed. 1903.
