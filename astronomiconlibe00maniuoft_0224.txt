11 509 COMMENTARY

of Capricorn regcmsszclel cl principem. Theagenes knew this as well
as Firmicus after him. And taking advantage of his knowledge, he
boldly affirmed to Augustus that Capricorn was the sign ‘horoscopating’
at his birth.

The degree of (1) confusion in the Calendar, (2') quackery in
Theagenes, (3) credulity in Augustus, which this hypothesis demands,
is so great that Scaliger's view has met with little acceptance.
Scaliger, however, is right in emphasizing the improbability of the view
that Suetonius did not know the time of Augustus’ birth. [The
difficulty was the subject of a correspondence between Scaliger and
Casaubon; Scaliger Epist. 1627, p. 154 sq. From what survives of
this correspondence, it appears that Scaliger in 1596 (four years before
his second edition) inclined to the view which the second edition
repudiates. He suspects that Augustus was born at sunset, Cancro
horoscopanie (since September, as he holds, fell then into what is now
July), when Capricorn would rise ἀκρονὺχως. Ι cannot find any letter
of Casaubon in which he attempts an answer to Scaliger's questions;
and his Suetonius—which had already appeared in 1595—has no note
at all on the passages in dispute.]

(3) Scaliger in his first edition put forward a view which has been
resuscitated recently by Housman. Libra is the sign of Augustus'
birth, Capricorn of his conception. (So, too, Breiter, arguing, how-
ever, from different—and false—premisses.) The star of conception is
not, like that of birth, the ascendant, but the star in which the sun is
situated at the time of conception. In support of this view Scaliger
appeals to ‘Demophilus ⁹—an error perpetuated by a long train of
Commentators, including Bouche—Leclercq and the latest editors of
Firmicus. The passage which Scaliger quotes from Demophilus
should be cited as ‘pseudo-Porphyrius' (εἰσαγωγὴ εἰς τήν ἀποτελε-
σματικῆν τοῦ Πτολεμαίου, p. 194, para. 1, BaSle, 1559); see Boll Berl.
Pltil. Woch. 1898, p. 202. It should read thus: περὶ σπομίμου ζῳδίου
ἡλίου· σπόριμον ἡλίου λέγουσι ζῴδιον ἐπὶ τῶν δωδεκαμηνιαίων τὸ εὐώνυμον
αὐτοῦ (solis) τετράγωνον ἐφ’ ὃ πορεύεται. ἐκεῖ γὰρ αὐτοῦ ὄντος (dum ibi
erat sol) ἡ σπορὰ ἐγένετο· ἐπὶ δέ τῶν ἑπταμηνιαίων τὸ διαμετροῦν. (This
applies to diurnal births; there follow, for nocturnal births, rules for
finding the σπόριμον ζῴδιον of the moon.) Housman (following
Bouche-Leclercq, pp. 377 sqq.) appeals to Censorinus D. N. 8. ξ 5.
If we take ξ 12 of the same chapter it will be clear that Censorinus and
pseudo-Porphyrius draw upon one and the same source: sol enim
a nono &odio particulam conceptionis rursum conspicit κατὰ τρίγωνον
et a decimo κατὰ τετράγωνον. And with pseudo-Porphyrius and
Censorinus may be set Ausonius Eclogorinm ii, De Ratione Puerperii
affuturi 11 sqq. Lines 11—12 merely versify Censorinus 8. ξ 5 Namque
ubi conceptus genitali insederit aruo, hand dubium Solem cuicumque
insistere signo. Censorinus, it is to be noted, thinks to determine
not merely the σπόριμον ζῴδιον but the particula conceptionis. He
was not, therefore, troubled by Mr. Housman's difficulty that ‘the
moment of conception is seldom discoverable' (Praef. lxxi3 what
Mr. Housman’s ‘seldom' means I do not know, the moment of
conception is never discoverable).

That this suggested solution is more plausible than any other
that has been offered I am not prepared to deny. Yet against it it
may fairly be urged—as it is urged by Housman—that it assumes
a blunder in Suetonius of which he was very unlikely to be guilty.
It would be strange if Suetonius, confronted with a horoscope of
