INTRODUCTION ΙΙΙ

if true, it disqualified Scaliger for the best results in Manilius, Ι
cannot say. That Scaliger makes blunders in astrology is cer-
tainly true, but Ι arn not clear that they arise from ignorance.¹
In Latin also he makes again and again bad blunders‚ propound-
ing interpretations of words and phrases and lines which a moment’s
reflection-so one would think-would have assured him were
false. The fact seems to be that to a great patience in research
he added, as is not uncommon‚ a certain impatience of the idea of
error in himself. He makes mistakes not at all because he does
not know better, but just because he does. It never occurs to him
that he can be wrong, that a great man can err as badly as Bonin-
contrius.

The faults, however, of Scaliger's editions do not deserve that
we should remember them. It is true that he was not charit-
able to the faults of others. But the students of Manilius with
whom he had to do were men who loved the darkness and hated
the light. Scaliger had cast upon the text of Manilius a mar-
vellous and almost magical illumination. But these men
refused to walk in the light. When we read, as they stand in the
second edition, Scaliger’s savage taunts and reproaches, the
worst we need think is that it was barely worth his while. Of
these enemies no one now knows the names:² but at the threshold
of Manilian criticism Scaliger stands alone. And indeed even
to-day he has no rival. The only possible rival is Bentley—so
much inferior in knowledge, in patience, in circumspecfion, and in
the faculty of grasping a whole, that only a native levity or the
caprice of reaction could place him on the same height as
Scaliger. These two, like Aries and Taurus, ‘ducunt signa⁷3 but

Judged by any standard Scaliger’s Manilius is a great work.
But it is also one of those works to which it is important to apply
a historical standard. It marks the dawn of a new kind of scholar-
ship. It breaks away from the desultory work of the Italian tradi-
tion. It founds a new tradition of which the leading idea is the
ordered exposition of some whole work. The day of haphazard
