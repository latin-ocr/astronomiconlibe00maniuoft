COMMENTARY

1—149. Prooemium. Similarly elaborated prooemia are prefixed to
each of the five books of the Astronomica, with the exception of the
last. ‘'Nzlnl illis dimnz'us, mlzil capi'oszus g7 amus et i'ucundzus dzcz'
potest? says Scaliger of them, justly (p. 21). There' is not much justice
or sympaghy in Conington⁷s criticism of them (Virgil, vol. i, ed. 4,
Appendzx

The prooemium to Book II falls into two fairly defined divisions.
In 1—49 Manilius reviews the‘ progress of poetry ’from its beginnings
down to his own time. The fountain-head is Homer. From him
‘ a thousand rills their progress take ’ (1—11).

Proximus Hesiodus: Hesiod's poetry is a poetry of nature and
origins, with mythology mingling some astronomy (ΙΙ-24). The
fabulistic astronomica] poets—Aratus?—are worth little (25—38).
Theocritus teaches the elevated treatment of a humble theme (39-42).
In sciences other than astronomy there is a considerable body of
poetry—Nicander (Ρ) and his Latin imitators (43-5). Even the science
of necromancy has its poets.

In 50—149 Manilius passes to the exposition os his own theme, its
originality (53— —9) )and its grandeur (60— 6). Ri ghtly viewed, it is
nothing else than a study of the divine reason. (There follows a
statement of the principal theses of the Stoic metaphysic. · the ξυμπάθειη

, of the different parts of the universe (67—128); the λόγος ὀρθός (129— 35), ·

εἱμαρμένη (113 sqq..) So high a theme is only for select souls. This
poem is addressed only to the few, The stars will hear it and
marvel; and so will a small band of men upon earth. Riches and
empire and pleasure are things transitory. This poem is occupied
with abiding interests.

Agamemnona, interpreting pam em as = ποιμένα λαῶν.

the variant tutamque). Hectoreamque is due to an accidental tra-

et melz is probably a bold emendation). Breiter reads aaslrcz duc um

interpretation from Isocr. Panassa. 88 (Agamemnon's army) στριιτό
