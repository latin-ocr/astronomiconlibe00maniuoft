MANILIUS AND HIS EDITORS

by Scaliger at Ι. 355, δίς. In appraising the value of his different
MSS. his marked penchant for Vossianus JJ, much as it misguided
him, betrays a sound instinct for the merits of M. In emenda-
tion, though usually clumsy, he was often right. And, speaking
generally, it may be said of him that he had a vigorous judgement
strangely compounded of good and bad. His feeling for the
Latin language was poor.

Jacob’s text, as I have just said, will be easily superseded by
that of Breiter. Breiter's text Ι reviewed¹ on its appearance
in a manner which I think did justice to its merits. Since then
I have been using it constantly‚ and my attention has perhaps
naturally been rather much fixed on its defects. But it is not
fair to compare any text of Manilius with what one thinks a text
should be: one should compare it with its existing rivals. And
of existing texts of Manilius Ι still think Breiter’s the most ser-
viceable. Of the Commentary which has recently followed the
text, Ι am sorry to be able to speak in terms only of very mixed
praise. Ihave not found it useful to myself3 and in Book ΙΙ,
where I have examined it with most care, Ι have often thought it
. wrong beyond the limits of what is excusable. Not to go outside
this Book—it is not, for example, excusable that at II. 485 Breiter
should render consilium ilbse sumn est as amat se. Not only can
the Latin not mean this, but it also involves us in egregiously false
astrology3 moreover, so far as I know, no previous editor has
fallen into Breiter's blunder. Still less is it excusable at 11. 722,
that in building up a whole series of complicated calculations‚ he
should start from the statement that ‘ if the moon is in the tenth
degree of Aries it will be in the dodecatemory of Sagittarius ’.
Yet Breiter not only makes this statement, but he bases upon
it a new and elaborate interpretation of a whole passage of
well known difficulty, while at the same time he prints a
numerical table in which all the figures <since they are taken
from other authorities) contradict everything that he has said in
his notes.

In one or two passages in my Commentary I have called attention
to other errrors hardly less notable. And Breiter's Commentary as
a whole, leaving as it does the impression that it was finished off
with undue haste, is to my mind not worthy osa scholar who has
