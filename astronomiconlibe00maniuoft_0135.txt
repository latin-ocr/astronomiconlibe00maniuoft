ASTRONOMICON II

Now is it right that having duly noted all these things,
you should next in order apply your mind to learning what
are the tutelary deities set over each sign, what sign nature
allotted to each of the Gods on that day when she gave
divine forms to the great virtues, and under holy names
established manifold influences and caused a living presence
to lend majesty to that wherein it dwells. Pallas protects
the Ram, Cytherea the Ball, Phoebus the beauteous Twins.
Thou, Mercmy, dost rule the Crab, and thou, Jupiter
thyself, together with the Mother of the Gods, the Lion.
The Maid that carries the sheaf belongs to Ceres, and the
metal-wrought Balance to Vulcan ; the fierce Scorpion
cleaves unto Mars. Diana hath a kindness to the huntsman
that is half horse, and Vesta to the huddled fires of
Capricorn. Aquarius, opposite Jove's sign, is the sign of
Juno. Neptune knoweth his own Fishes, beholding them in
the sea. From these facts also you will derive principles
of great import for the knowledge of the future. When
your reason passes swiftly through both planets and signs,
on this hand and on that you will need to seek the way of
proof and the path of knowledge, that the divine power
may rise and reveal itself to thought, and that the hearts
· of men may have a saith sure as the heavens are sure.

Learn now how the parts of the human body are dis-
tributed among the signs, and behold each member plainly
allocated to its own constellation. In the parts of the body
so distributed the signs exercise the powers which concern
that part, out of the whole body, which belongs to them.
The Ram, chief of the signs, has for his special province
the head; the beauty of the human neck falls within the
arbitrament of the Bull; the two arms, with shoulders
conjoined, are assigned in equal division to the Twins ; the
breast is placed under the Crab, the Lion holds sway over
the sides and back. The loins come down to the Maid as
her proper lot. The Balance governs the buttocks‚ the
Scorpion has his glory in the genitals, the thighs are subject
to the Centaur, Capricorn is lord of both the knees, the
legs are in the power of the Water-carrier‚ and the Fishes
claim for themselves the governance of the feet.
