ASTRONOMICON II

Not more fortunate is that portion of the sky which lies
above the Setting, or that again which is beneath the
Rising‚ Heaven. The one is tumbling headlong, the other
hangs trembling: fearing either to meet its end in the
cardinal house beneath‚ or, robbed of its support, to fall
utterly. These dread regions are rightly named the realm
of Typho, that giant whom the grim Earth bare, and brought
forth withal war in heaven. Not less in stature than their
mighty mother were those giant sons of Earth. But the
bolt of Jupiter drove them back again into the deep: the
hills closed over them as they fell: and Typhoeus passed
to where the mountain-side buries all his living and battling.
Their very mother shakes with sear at the fire of them that
burst forth beneath Aetna. The region which is below
and next to the summit of the shining sky, would scarce
yield even to that star whereto it is neighbour. Of braver
hope than its rivals and moving to the palm, victorious
over them that went before, it rises higher than them
all, and stands comrade to the topmost limit. Yet is
there lest for it a course only to a place lower than
the highest, nor do its hopes live. And so marvel not
that, being nearest to the summit and yet below the

« Realm of Blessedness, it bears the name Fortunate. So

best may our speech approach to the golden speech of
Greece and render name for name. Jupiter here dwells.
Put thou thy trust in the fortune that presides here. Like
unto this region, but with inverse likeness, is that which
shines from the opposed quarter of heaven, sunk beneath
the sky and touching the foundation-pillars of the submerged
universe. Wearied with a warfare scarce ended, yet is this
region again enlisted for new toils‚ and ready to take upon
itself the scales of its cardinal house and all that mighty
influence. Not yet does it feel the weight of the world,
but already yearns for the glory of bearing it. This region
the Greeks call Daemom‘e: our Roman speech lacks words
wherewith to render that title. But do you bear in mind with
care the region and the name and note of the mighty diety
indwelling there. These things hereafter may be recalled
to serve great uses. In this region more than elsewhere are
set the issues of our bodily health: here is arrayed that
