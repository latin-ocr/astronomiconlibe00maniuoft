This calculation would not bring Augustus’ birth under Capricorn
according to our present reckonings, by which the sun enters that
sign on Dec. 22. But the astronomers of Cicero's time, as I have
said, placed the beginnings of the signs some 7 degrees in advance
of our reckonings. If, therefore, Augustus was born on Sept. 22
paulo ante solis exortum, Capricorn was his natal sign.

No one familiar with the literature upon the Reformation of the
Calendar will suppose that these conclusions are as free from difficulty
as they here appear.¹ Yet they are perhaps as plausible as any rival
reckonings. And they seem to afford a simpler explanation of our
present text than any that has been hitherto put forward.

In the Ashmole collection of MSS. in the Bodleian Library
(Aslz.394, pp. 208 a—212b) are preserved two dissertations upon this
passage which constitute perhaps the only discussion of it between
Scaliger 1600 and Freier 1880. The first is by one Bernard, whom
Ι take to be Edward Bernard,² Savilian Professor of Astronomy (for his
connexion with Manilius see Introduction, p. xliii). The other, of
interest to Manilian students generally, is by Sherburne (see Intro-
duction, p. lxxxv). Bernard makes a petulant attack upon Scaliger.
(⁴ How does he ride and read poor Manilius ἔ What pittiful pedantry
is this? Is to write proudly and ignorantly to write like Scaliger?')
Reading ipsam in 507 and quae fulserit in 509 he maintains that
Augustus was born under Virgo, on Sept. 23 of the Julian year.
Capricorn upon the coins of Augustus is merely ‘ an hieroglyphick of
dominion'. Vespasian and Titus both stamped their coins with the
nota Capricorni. But Vespasian teste Suetonio was born xv. Kal. Dec„
‘so that he must have had it (Capricorn) in y0 meridiari rather.²
Libra (under which Scaliger in ed. i affirmed Augustus to have been
born) is the horoscope of Rome and Italy. Theagenes could hardly
have made the error Scaliger attributes to him, being ‘a man not
improbably one of the coajutors contriving that most excellent
Calender ’ (the Julian).

Sherburne points out that Bernard has relied on a false text at
507 and 509, and that the true text there is supported not only by
Suetonius but also by Germanicus. Augustus was born under
Capricoxn, but conceived (genitus) under Libra, cf. felix aequato

¹ The principal difficulty is that alleged by Soltau, p. 54—the eclipse of the
moon in 63 Β. C. at the time of the Feriae Latinae: Cicero De Suo cons.
11·211T-}{3·Catalogue says ‘ Fra. Bernard'. Fra. Bernard once in a letter to
w. Lilly (MS. Aslz. 242, 85 b) mentions Manilius. But his interests were
almost wholly in modern astrology.
