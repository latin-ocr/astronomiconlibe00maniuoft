11 509 COMMENTARY

year contained 67 intercalary days in all. Stoffel has no doubt
rightly explained this contradiction in our authorities. He supposes ²
that there were, as all authorities agree, three intercalary months;
but that they were of the normal length of a mensis Mercedonius,
i. e. 23 4 22 ÷ 22 days in all. Accepting this as correct we get the
following :—

13. C. Fre-J ulian Julian

45 Jan. 1 Jan. 2
46 Dec. 1 Dec. 4
46 Posterior 1 Nov. 12
46 Prior 1 Oct. 21
46 N ov. 1 Sept. 22
46 Oct. 1 Aug. 22
46 Sept. 22 (= ix. Kal. Oct.) Aug. 14
Then (47-46, consisting of 355 ÷ 23 days).

47 Sept. 22 Aug. 1
48 Sept. 22 Aug. 11
49 Sept. 22 Aug. 21
50 Sept. 22 Sept. 1
51 Sept. 22 Sept. 11
52 Sept. 22 Sept. 21

We know from various sources (1) that there was no intercalation
between 52 and 46 2; (2) that 52 contained a Mercedonius (of 23 days)
(Asconiusz Milo 31, p. 36 Clark); (3) that 52 began on a market day
(Dio Cassius xl. 47. ξ 1).

We can calculate‚ therefore, the number of days from 52 10 41
inclusive, thus :—

B. C.

52 378
5Ῑ 355
50 355
49 355
48 , 355
47 355
46 422
45 365
44 365
43 365
42 365
41 366

Total 4401 days.

Market days recurred at intervals of eight days. In these twelve
years, therefore, we have 550 market days 4 1 day. Our figures,
therefore, are quite consistent with the attested facts that 52 began,
and 41 ended, on a market day.

Between 52 and 63 no intercalation is attested. We reach,
therefore, the following results for those years :—

¹ Guerre Civile ii. 299-304.
