THE MSS. OF MANILIUS AND THEIR
INTERRELATION

‘Loxiae oracula mihi audire uideor quotiens Manilium lego: ita multa
sunt in eo turpiter conturbata, lacera, mutila, prodigiose obscura.'—CARR10.

‘Infelix satum illius poetae ut neque posteri eius meminerint neque eius
exemplaria ulla bona fide scripta extent.¹—SCAL1GER‚ Epist. 1627, p. 165.

THE THREE PRINCIPAL MSS.

THERE are twenty-two MSS. of the Astronomica still extant.
- These fall into three families, which may be designated the Belgian,
the Italian, and the Hungarian. The Belgian family is represented
by GLC V Marc. 3 the Italian by M V ²URH Caes. 3 the Hungarian
by the Paris MS. Par. 8022 ,- the Munich MS. Mon. 157455 the
two Oxford MSS„ b and 0 3 and finally seven MSS. from Italian
libraries, Vatt. 1-4‚ Pal„ Βανά, Laur. Of these three families
the last and most numerous, the Hungarian, may safely be said
to have no importance at all, being merely a product of a chance
fusion of the Belgian and Italian families. This fusion was perhaps
brought about in the Hungarian libraries of Ofen and Gran under
the auspices of Vitezius, Galeotto, and Regiomontanus.¹

Of the five MSS. of the Belgian family two only can be certainly
said to possess independent value, Gand L. Probably Cis a copy
of L, and still more probably Alarc. of C.² The six MSS. of the
Italian family, again, are really reducible to one, It is becoming
generally agreed among editors that V² URHCaes. are all derived,
mediately or immediately, from ΛΝ

Our twenty-two MSS. of the Astronomzza are thus brought
