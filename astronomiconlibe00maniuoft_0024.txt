INTRODUCTION I

tions are defective‚¹ his main contention—that A contained 22 lines
to the page—is assured. Bechert,² Housman‚³ and Thielscher⁴
have, since Jacob, all contributed something to the solution of
difficulties. In what follows I hope, availing myself of the work
os all of them, to carry the study of the archetype a few steps
further.

In Book Ι, 35 5-98 have become, in all our MSS„ transposed
with 399—4423 and again, 530—65 with 566-611. Now 355-98
and 399-442 each consist of 44 lines, and they are separated from
530 by 88 lines (strictly 87 lines 3 but a line has probably been
lost ⁵ after 463). 5 30-6 5, again, may be regarded as the wreckage
of 44 lines 3 for 564-5 are pretty certainly spurious, and there is
an undoubted lacuna after 563. Finally, 566-611 are reduced to
44 lines by the consideration that 566—8 are interpolated.

T hat these figures point to the fact that each of the pages in A
contained 22 lines (44 lines to the folium) is agreed by everybody.⁶
But neither Jacob nor Bechert nor Thielscher has, I think, made
it clear how the confusion of the folia of A which caused these
transpositions in Book Ι was brought about. We have to deal
with two distinct transpositions, each involving 88 lines, and
separated from one another by 88 undisturbed lines. Can we
divine any single cause (some one mechanical error) which would
explain at one and the same time both transpositions? Ι think
that we can. Lines 35 5—611 occupied in A 12 pages = 6 folia
3 sheets. If of these three sheets the second had by an error in
the binding been placed before the first, this single blunder would
produce both the transpositions in question. The reader can test
this at once for himself by laying three sheets of paper upon one

¹ e. g. on I. 530—611. The leaves of A, again, were certainly not ‘dupli—
cata ’‚ nor was it written litteris quadratis.

⁶ 1 at one time thought that a page of 44 lines (88 lines to the folium) in
double columns would best explain these figures. To this suggestion, put
forward casually in a sootnote in the C. Q„ ii. 126, Ι was largely led by
a consideration os certain facts (mentioned below on p. xxv) in connexion
with M—facts which Ι now interpret differently. The assumption osa page
of 44 lines involves the hypothesis that two separate folia in A (and these
not consecutive) had been accidentally detached and become, in replacing,
inverted„ The hypothesis which 1 now adopt will be seen, I think, at once
to be infinitely more simple and more probable.
