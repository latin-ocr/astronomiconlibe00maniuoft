OTHER MSS.

I compared its readings carefully with those which Thielscher has
recorded from Marcianus. I was at first half inclined to identify
the two MSS„ but certain discrepancies proved too strong for this
hypothesis. So closely do the two agree, however, that I have
little doubt but that Pithoeanus is derived from Marcianus or
some copy of Marcianus. Further‚ it is possible that Par. is
descended from Pithoeanus. It agrees with Pithoeanus in omit-
ting III. 370.¹

3. Vossianus tertius. The Bodleian Library possesses a copy
(Auct. 0. 5. 17) of the editio Bononiensis, containing a collation
of that text with some MS. of Manilius designated V, This copy
bears on the fly-leaf in faded letters the name ‘Isaaci Vossii'.
The readings in this collation correspond in detail with those of
no known MS. Yet they reveal sufficiently the cognation of the
MS. from which they are taken. This MS. omitted all the lines
omitted by the Cusanus, and may therefore be regarded as
descended from that MS. 3 see below. In addition it omitted the
whole of IV. 10—320 (sic). In GL IV. 10—313 are transposed to
follow III. 399. Nothing is said in the collation of any trans-
position at ΙΙΙ. 399, and we may conclude therefore that in V ⁸
· (for 50, I think, we are entitled to designate this MS.) an attempt
had already been made to rectify the disorder: an attempt, how-
ever, which resulted in the complete loss not only of IV. 10—313‚
but of the seven following lines in addition. Other peculiarities of
V³ are that it omits ΙΙ. 716-17 (which are also not found in the
Palatinus) and V. 335. At ΙΙ. 592 it has mortique locatur, and
reads at IV. 745 gelidum tepidi per tempora neris. At Ι. 916
it omits alea, but a late hand has written in Leucas.²

Ellis in the Introduction to his Noctes Mam'lz’anae2 mentions
this Bodleian collation. He says of it, however‚ mistakenly, that
it is a collation of V1. That this is impossible is clear from what
I have already said—particularly from the lacuna IV. 10—320.
But V ¹ and V ³ are very twins none the less.

The Bodleian contains yet another collation of V ³ made with
the text of Scaliger's first edition, Paris, 1579 (Auct. S. 5. 29).

¹ Omitted also by M: on the significance os this omission see Thielscher,
I. c. His explanation applies also to 11. 524 om. M Cus. (independently).
² The titulus to Lib. 11 ‘NL Manili nmthenmtici‘ shows that V3 is not
wholly free from the ‘ Italian ’ inssuence.
