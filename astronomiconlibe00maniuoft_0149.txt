ASTRONOMICON II

there are motions of craft among them. The Scorpion,
under cover of friendship‚ scatters bane. But those whose
entrance into light the Fishes guard, abide not ever true to
one purpose. Their hearts change ever and anon, they
break ties and seek again to bind them, and down their
front travels hidden corruption. Thus shall you mark
peace and war as foretold in the signs: to laws such as
{hese are those that are born upon the earth subject from
irth.

It is not sufficient merely thus to attend to the signs in
isolation. You must contemplate the general position of
the heavens and the place of the planets. The signs alter
their character (and their line changes its powers) according
as they distribute their parts. Hence it is that the sky
now gives to them, now withdraws from them their strength,
and those signs which here take wrath into them lay it
aside by being carried otherwhither. For squares have
their own prerogatives, so too triangles‚ so again those
signs which the line of the hexagon traverses, so once again
those traversed by that line which cuts transversely the
centre of the heaven. [For it makes a difference whether
signs are just rising, or are climbing the heaven, or are
—setting.] Usually opposed signs are hostile. Blood-
relationships belong to square signs, friendships to triangles.
Nor is the reason of this obscure. For all through the
Zodiac the signs which nature has placed to be each the
fourth sign from the other are of the same sex, Four signs
mark out the heaven in equal division: they are those in
which God has located the turning-points of the year. For
the Ram brings the springtime, the Crab the corn, the
Balance the vintage, and the Goat-Fish, begotten for
cold, brings winter. <These are the signs which protect
blood-kindred.> Those signs again which are compacted
of two forms are each the fourth sign from the other. This
you may see in the two Fishes, the Twins‚ the double Maid,
and the Centaur‘s two bodies wrought in one woof. Because
of this tie these signs are reckoned as wellnigh equal to
the signs of blood-kindred. Yet another square is formed
by the single signs. (For the Bull is without a consort,
the grim Lion has no yoke-fellow‚ the Scorpion that fears
no one is alone, and the Water-carrier is reckoned as
a single sign), and because of their singleness these are
