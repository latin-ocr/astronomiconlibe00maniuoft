MANILIUS AND HIS EDITORS

soon came back again. It would seem, in fact, that neither
under the Republic nor under the first two Emperors did their
science ever meet serious molestation. There were always of
course worthless ‘Isiaci coniectores' and ‘astrologi de circo '‚
just as always every science or art has its charlatans3 and these
did somethIng to discredit astrology as a whole. But the science
seems mostly to have commanded a fair treatment and to have
attracted, on the part of thoughtful men, at least a tolerant
curiosity. Under the Republic it hit an occasional vogue without
perhaps securing (until near the close of the period) a permanent
respectability. Under the early Principate it enjoyed, through
Stoicism‚ the favour of most that was respectable, as well as of
much that was fanatical, in Rome. It could never, of course, bc
wholly exempt from such persecutions as the brutal and timid
inflict fitfully upon the wise.· Tacitus, as we have seen, speaks
now and again contemptuously or wrathfully of the pretension or
iniquity of the astrologers. Yet he has bequeathed to us, in
a chapter¹ of valuable digression, a dignified and impressive
summary of his more deliberated reflections upon this art. ‘ My
judgement wavers‚' he says: ‘I dare not say whether it be fate
and necessity immutable which governs the changing course of
human affairs—or just chance. Among the wisest of the ancients‚
as well as among their apes, you will find a conflict of opinion.
Many hold fixedly the view that our beginning and our end—
that man himself—is nothing to the Gods at all. The wicked
are in prosperity and the good meet tribulation. Others believe
that Fate and the facts of this world work together. But this
connexion they trace not to planetary influences but to a con-
catenation of natural causes. We choose our life—that is free:
but the choice once made, what awaits us is fixed and ordered.
Good and evil are different from the vulgar opinion of them.
Often those who seem to battle with adversity are to be accounted
blessed ; but the many even in their prosperity are miserable. It
needs only to bear misfortune bravely, while the fool perishes in
his wealth. Outside these rival schools stands the man in the
street. No one will take from him his conviction that at our
birth are fixed for us the things that shall be. If some things
fall out differently from what was foretold, that is due to the
deceit of men that speak what they know not: calling into
