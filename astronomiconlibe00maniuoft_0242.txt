11 722 COMMENTARY

any given sign the degree in which the moon stands at a birth;
multiply the number of the degree by 12. Distribute the result
obtained among the signs, giving 30 to each sign—beginning with the
sign in which the moon stands. The sign in which you are left with
a remainder less than 30 is the sign in whose dodecatemory the moon
is. Thus, if the moon be in the fourteenth degree of Aries : 14 >< 12 =
168. Of this 168 Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo each receive
30. ln Virgo, therefore, you get a remainder less than 30. The
moon, accordingly, is in the dodecatemory of Virgo. This method is
the method expounded e.g. by Manilius’ plagiarist Firmicus; and it
exactly corresponds to the method followed by Manilius in 726-36

This method is said by the scholiast upon Paulus Alexandrinus to
be that of οἱ παλαιοί. It is followed not only by Firmicus and Paulus,
but also by Dorotheus of Sidon. (Bouche-Leclercq, 300-1.) But
there was in antiquity yet another method, found e. g. in ‘Demo-
philus' (= pseudo-Porphyrius) (quoted by Scaliger), and followed, to
the exclusion of any other, by Ptolemy. This consisted in taking the
number of the degree in which, in any sign, the moon (or any planet)
stood, dividing that number among the signs in order (beginning w1th
the sign in which the moon is) so that each sign receives 2}- XVhen

precisely that which 732—4 are trying to express. But inserted in‘the
place and manner in which they have been inserted, the lines only
produce complete confusion. Leave them there, and you get two
different methods of producing an identical result combined together
in one method to produce a wholly false and absurd result. They
perform twice an operation which requires to be performed only once,
though it may be performed in two different ways. They are, in fact,
the work of some interpolator or annotator who missed in Manilius
the method of Ptolemy, 01· ‘Demophilus ’, with which he was familiar.
The fact that the lines are not represented in the reproduction of
Firmicus is in itself some presumption against their genuineness.
Bentley’s position is put by him so clearly and forcibly that it
might well have been thought that no one could miss its cogency-
Yet Jacob, Bechert, and Breiter, following upon Bentley, have one and
all utterly misunderstood the passage. Bechert's position may be
allowed the merit of inscrutability. But Jacob and Breiter remain in
regions where they are still open to refutation. Both of them accept
Bentley's correction of 731. They are thus obliged to assume, as
against Scaliger, Du Fay, Bechert, δια, that 726—36 are all part of
a single calculation. The result in Jacob’s case is that he takes the
degree (x) in which the moon stands; he multiplies this by 12 and
gives, from the result, 30 to each sign3 when he is left with a
remainder less than 30 he takes this remainder and gives from it 2} to
each of the remaining signs. He finds the dodecatemory of the moon
