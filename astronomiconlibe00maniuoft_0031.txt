THE THREE PRINCIPAL MSS.

a text thatv will construe, M is a M'S.'for a scholar. ‘Divinare
oportet, non legere ’‚ says Poggio of the MS. which he sends to
Francesco Barbar0; and the joy of M is the necessity of exercising
divinatio upon it. And this joy is a holy one just for the reason
that M is ‘ sincere ’. Its scribe is dealing straight with us, and he
deserves in return a proportionate consideration. M is worth
emending because it has not been emended already—or has only
very rarely been emended. Such emendations as are to be
found in it are probably not due to the scribe who copied it.
T hat sincere but unscholarly man—who writes nasantia for
nascentia (Ι. 156), crauz't et for Iuppiter (Ι. 431), lumilia for lumina
(Ι. 621), and the rest of it—-was not capable of such a brilliant con-
jecture as Offilzeu de for Orphiucus at Ι. 331. ΜΓ. Housman says
that throughout Μ he has noticed only three downright inter-
polati0ns; of which I. 331 is one3 another is m‘am (for procul)
Ι. 851—where Ι fancy that procul and m‘am are both false, but
that uiam points us to the truth 3 the third is IV. 776 possidet for
condidit, where the whole line is spurious. If Mr. Housman
had studied M a little more carefully he would have added

Δ to his list. For example, not to go beyond the very book

which he has edited with such skill and aplomb, at 128 mede est is
clearly interpolated3 at 309 nitentia has been altered in M to
lucentia (as though nitentia) 3 at 323 effulgent has been changed to
fulgent, rhythmi gratia; at 348 sor rapido M has diuo, an obvious
emendation of radip03 at 435 similem morsum is one of the
clumsiest and most manifest emendations ever made; at 723,
where GL· have mundum faithfully (for nondum, to which Ellis
brilliantly and certainly corrected it), M has mundus. All these
places afford examples of rather bad tampering with the text. But
they are not due, as I think, to the scribe of M.¹
Let me now first call attention to a few places where M has
been faithful m small things, and has the reward of such fidelity.
1.422- 3. tum di quoque magnos
quaesiuere deos, Rationem Iuppiter ipse.
deos, esurtionem M, which I have emended as above (urtio-
nem- — tutionem- - rationem): deos, dubitauit GL.
dubitauit is probably a mere gloss upon rationem ᾳῑιαεςῑτιίμί

¹ They represent, perhaps, marginalia os M’s original. This would explain
their absence from GL. They may have come into A after A had been
copied by the common source of GL.
