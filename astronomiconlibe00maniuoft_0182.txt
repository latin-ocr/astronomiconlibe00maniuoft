ΙΙ 91-2 COMMENTARY

moon, of course, each independently influence the tides. Each by
attraction raises the ocean in the direction of itself; and at the same
time the mass of earth on the side furthest from either sun or moon
feels the attraction of either body more than does the sea on the same
side, and so is drawn away, producing the apparent effect of a rise of
ocean (or tide) at the end of earth most remote from sun or moon.
The attraction of the moon ¹ is greater than that of the sun because by
its less distance from the earth it more than compensates its inferiority
in size to the sun. When the sun and moon act along a straight line
(i. e. when the moon is furthest from, or nearest to, the sun), then the
tides are greatest (‘ spring tides ’). ΧΥῙιεῃ the sun and moon act at
right angles to one another then the tides are least (‘ neap tides ’),
because from the attracting power of the moon that of the sun has to
be subtracted.

92, therefore, remarks the effect of the sun in producing neap
tides. Manilius, in fact, is saying nothing more complicated, or
philosophie, than Lucan i. 413—16 an sidere mota secundo Tethyos unda
uagae lunaribus aestuet horis, flamnger an Titan, ut alentes hauriat
undas, mjgrat oceanum. It may be noticed in passing that Lucan’s
sidere secundo explains the bare sidere of Manilius.

Both the older, and more recent, commentators have introduced
considerable confusion into this passage, the former by mistranslating
the Latin, the latter by attempting to force Manilius into conformity
with Posidonius. Scaliger and Du Fay both take recessu in 91 of the
ebb of the tide. (Scaliger might have learnt better from the despised
Bonincontrius, who avoids this error.) Neither of them, however,
cite in support of this—as they should have done—Cicero de Div.
xiv. 34 aestibus . . . quorum accessus et recessus lunae motu guber·
uantur, a passage which Manilius would almost seem to have had
before him in xwiting this; not only is the general theme of the two
passages (the cognatio—de Div. ξ 33, cf. cognatis here in 67—of the
different parts of the mundus) the same, but in ξ 33 Cicero actually
cites the fact, or fancy, noted by Manilius at 94, where see note. Yet
despite this close relation of the two passages, recessu in our present
passage cannot refer to the movement of the sea„ but must refer to
that of the moon. A moment⁷s reflection should satisfy any one that it
is nonsense to speak of the seditio pelagi (the rise and fall of the
tides) as stimulated by the recessus, the fall of the tides. Yet this
nonsense Du F ay gravely repeats from Scaliger. Huet and Bentley
appear to have understood the passage. But Pingre seems to be the
first after Bonincontrius ( who has, however, not understood the
passage) to define precisely the meaning of recessus. Breiter's
⁴ Abnahme’ is more or less adequate. sidere and diuerso recessu
give us two opposed points in the moon’s course—its greatest and
least distance from the sun.

Cicero de Di-za ii. 42. 89 uses recessus. as it is here used, of the
motion of a planet z caeli conuersiones commmotionesque tantaefiant
accessu stellarum el recessu. For diuerso, ''diametrically opposed‚'
cf. 280 diuerso conspicit artu.

Breiter’s view of this passage is vitiated by his passion for
‘Quellenforschung’. According to him 89 gives the ἡμερησία κίνησις
of the sea, 90 its μηιίαία κίνησις, 91 its ἐνιαισιά κίνησις· ς alnd So all squar&
with Posidonius—or very nearly, sor Posidonius introduces the winds,

¹ The moon's tide is about two and a half times as great as the sun's.
