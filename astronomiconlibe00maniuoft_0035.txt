THE THREE PRINCIPAL MSS.

weakened, but it ought not to be allowed to destroy wholly this
authority. Bechert, who had both G and M before him, very
greatly overrated the comparative worth of the older MS. He is
throughout blind to the patent weaknesses of G, and to all the
virtues, whether patent or latent, of M. Mr. Housman, on the
other hand, ever ready to find good in all MSS. and evil in all
editors, will not allow that either MS. is one whit superior to the
other. He stands judicially between two bundles of hay, and
pronounces them both equally palatable (the figure is his own).¹
M is as good as G and G as M. Very similar is the position of
Breiter. But a violent reaction against G was bound to come
before long. And recently a German scholar, P. T hielscher‚² has
put forward the opinion that G has no independent value whatever.
He wishes to banish its readings for ever from any Apparatus to
Manilius. He regards it as nothing more than an interpolated
copy of L. Though I notice with surprise that Thielscher seems
already to have converted Kraemer,³ Ι do not fancy that his attack
upon G will be regarded as successful by the majority of Manilian
students. One important merit may be conceded to Thielscher.

, He has done good service in emphasizing the strength and

sincerity of L. But his onslaught upon G is, Ι think, mis-
calculated.

Mr. Housman, on p. xxv of his edition of Book 1, has com-
piled a list of passages where the reading of G is clearly superior
to that of the other MSS. This list might be longer than it is3
but I will content myself by selecting a few examples from it 2——

ΙΙ. 15 Iouis et G: iuuisse LM. 19 notauit G: rogauit LM.
168 exterius mirantur GL'2: exterminantur LM. 473 generant
G: gerant [Μ 584 lis G2L2: leuis GLM. 111. 69 sorte G:

multum LM. 243 Vesta tuos GL2: uastat uos L: restat uos M.
282 illuc agilem G: huc caliginem LM (caligine M). V. 46
ortus G: portus L: portur Μ.

In all these places G, sometimes supported by the corrector of
L? has the true reading where LM have a false reading. Now
where LM agree in error, especially in senseless and unmetrical

³ Bursian’s jalzresbericlet, 1908, pp. 234-51, Abt. ii.

⁴ Now and again L² alone among our codices has the true reading : e. g.
in Book 11. 533 tergore cedit, 600 populo.
