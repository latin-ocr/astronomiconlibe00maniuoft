ASTRONOMICON II

sphere of heaven rests wholly on them as upon ethereal
hinges. Were it not that in succession they carry this
flying sphere in its never-sailing circuit, binding it with
bands through its two sides and through the lowest and the
highest of its regions, the heavens would dissolve and their
fabric part in twain and disappear.

But the influence which resides in each of these cardinal
points is different. They vary according as they are placed,
and according to the order in which they are separated
from one another, First of them is that which holds sway
in the topmost height of heaven and divides the mid sky by
an airy line. This post high-enthroned is the dwelling-place
of Glory. And truly to this supreme station fitly belongs
the protection of whatsoever can claim for itself pre-eminence‚
and arrogate all honour, and reign by lavish distribution
of high offices. Hence comes applause and the appeal to
the eye and every form of popular favour: the greatness
that gives to citizens civil rights, that brings all the world
under the rule of peaceful laws, that joins in just alliance
races unallied, and that exalts the fame of each man in his
proper station. Second, albeit in a station farthest removed,
is that point which bears the sphere poised on its ever-

” lasting foundations. Its influence is less in outward show,

but greater in practical utility: yea, greater in influence is
that which is thus less in show, because, by the very region
it occupies, it controls the foundations of things and governs
wealth. It examines, when mines are dug, how far hopes
have been ratified, and how much you may win out of the
hidden values of the earth. The third post is mighty in
that it divides the world into equal parts. It controls the
Rising Heaven, where first the stars ascend, where day
begins to return and apportion time among the hours.
Hence is it that in Greek cities it is called ‘Horoscope’,
nor will it admit an alien name, since it has pleasure in its
own. With this post is the arbitrament of life, the regula-
tion of character: it gives happy issue to our undertak-
ings and leads us to all skill ; it determines the first years
that await a man from birth, what education he receives,
unto what station of life he is born, according as the planets
co-operate and intermingle their influences. The last post,
