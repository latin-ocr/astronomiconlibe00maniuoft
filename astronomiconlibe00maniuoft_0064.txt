INTRODUCTION III

as Ellis‘ and as hasty as Housman ² seem alike inclined to accept.
Others understand Sylvester to be speaking in both passages of
Anicius Manlius Torquatus Severinus Boetius, the author, that
is, of the famous work On the Consolation of Philosophy. Now if
we had only the reference in Sylvester to ‘viii uolumina Boetii de
astrologia' it is quite certain that no one would ever have dreamed
of finding in it a reference to our Manilius. Of our Manilius we
have to-day, after all, only five uolumina ; and the criticism which
would identify these with the ‘viii uolumina' of Sylvester would
be too frankly Procrustean to be worth a serious consideration
were it not for Sylvester's other reference to ‘M. Manlius de
Astrologia'. Sylvester, it is urged,³ could never have spoken of
the author of the Consolation as ‘Manlius't he must have said
Boetius. I have elsewhere⁴ shown, as I think, conclusively that
this is a false assumption. For Sylvester's pupil‚ Richer, uses
‘Manlium ' without qualification for ‘Boetium '. And he so uses
it in a passage5 in which he is actually describing a lecture of
Sylvester’s 3 and a passagef’ again in which ‘Manlius' is coupled
with the very writer with whom Sylvester, in our letter, conjoins
him—the rhetorician Victorinus. We can hardly doubt that, in
describing Sylvester's lecture, Richer says ‘Manlius' just because
he had often heard the lecturer so speak of Βοεῐῑίιιε.6 Moreover,
the fourteenth-century Sorbonne Catalogue, N. LIII. 9, has, as
I have also pointed out elsewhere‚⁴ ‘Anicii Manlii ⁷, without the
addition ‘Boetii ², for the author of the Consolatz'on.

How, then, are we to explain the addition ‘Boeti' after the
name of Manilius in the MSS. of the Italian family? It might
seem that there was something to be said for the ingenious
suggestion of Kraemer‚ that Boeti‚ Boeci‚ Poeni represent an
original ‘poetae clarissimi '. This description is added after the
name of Manilius in several of those MSS. from which ‘Boeti' is
absent. ‘Poetae clarissimi’ was perhaps written in contracted
form ‘poe. cl. '-—and this might have passed into ‘Poeci' or the
like. But against Kraemer it is to be urged that those MSS.
which have this addition ‘poetae clarissimi' seem all to be
