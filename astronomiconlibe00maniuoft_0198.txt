II 253-61 COMMENTARY

cares more for matter than for metre?’ Soo, too, Bitterauf. But
Manilius is an extremely careful metrist. He was as little likely to
follow Ennius apud Varr. L. L. vii. 12 (contra tueri) in shortening the
last syllable of contra as he was to anticipate Ausonius De Rat.
Pnerperii Malum· 40 in shortening the second syllable of trigonum.
Servius’ contra‘ carinantes (Aen. viii. 361), also from Ennius, is doubtful.
Lucilius apud Nonium, p. 153. 17 has, perhaps in the beginning of
a hexameter, contra uenis. At Plautus Pseud. 156 we should, I think,
read adsistite omnes meque contra quae loquor adnortite animum ; see
Lindsay's App. Crit. ad loc. (contra in Carm. Eszgr. 1254 Biicheler
is from a period aster Hadrian). Analogy will help us but little.
frustra‘, for example, is frequent in Plautus. So Auson. Tetrastt'clz.
3· 3. Nearer to our purpose is Catullus lxvi. 66 Callisto iuxta
Lycaoniam, where, however, Ellis rightly inclines to Parthenius’
iuncta Lycaoniae. (F riedrich’s argument, however, that iuxta in
Catullus could not be used as a preposition is as worthless as the
inverse objection employed at Plaut. Pseud. 156 (above) that contra
is not used in Plautus as an adverb.)

254. incumbens terrae qnae est snb plano eins pectore, Bentley.
plano sub pectore = Ovid Am. i. 5. 21.

25 5. in latus obliqui: obuersz· inter se, Du F ay, wrongly.
‘Swimming' is all that this phrase means. Stat. Theb. vi. 544 has
in latus ire manu sor ‘to swim’3 and Ι take the opportunity of
explaining here a passage of Ovid's Metamm'plzoses iii. 186-8—

quae quanquam comitum turba est stipata suarum,

gn latus obliquum tamen adstitit, oraque retro
exit

—of Diana at the bath, when Actaeon came upon her. She did not
stand slanth'se, as commentators make her do. She did the natural
thing under the circumstances. She threw herself into a swinzming
pasture, immersing herself, and, as Ovid goes on to say, splashing
water into Actaeon’s face.

2 56-64. Signa Debilia: Scorpion, Taurus, Cancer, Sagittarius.

258. The Scorpion and its claws (Chelae) occupy the space of two
signs. The Scorpion is debile in so far as its Claws are lost in Libra.
(From the first century onward astronomical writers came more and ·
inore to use ‘Libra’ for ‘Chelae ’. It has been supposed that
‘Libra' (Ζυγός) was introduced first by Hipparchus; see Bouche-
Leclercq‚ p. 141.) Verg. Geor-g. i. 34-5 tibi iam bracchia contrahit
ardens Scorpius et caeli iusta plus parte reliquit3 Germ. A rat.
448-9 (maiorem) Scorpius hinc duplex qnam cetera possidet orbem
sidera, per Chelas geminato lumine fulgens. Scorpion may thus be
regarded indifferently as either duplex (duplus) or debilis.

259—60. lumina Cancro desunt: cf. ii. 494—5 Cancer and Capricorn
in semet uertunt oculos. Cancer’s blindness is thus due to the
geometrical doctrine of ἀντίσκια (expounded at 466 sqq.).

261. A man, to parody Solon's saying, may best bear ill-fortune by
seeing the constellations in a worse condition. The same idea occurs
in a somewhat different form in Pliny JV. H. ii. 7. 26 imperfectae uero
in homine naturae praecipua solatia, ne a'eum quidem posse omnia.
Bouche-Leclercq compares, also from Pliny, (of eclipses) quis enim
cernens non suae necessitati mortales genitos ignoscat (N. H. ii. ξ 55).
Similar is Seneca Prov. v, 8. Add Rutil. Nam. 121—2 aduersis
solemne tuis sperare secunda: exemplo caeli ditia damna sttbz's. For
