COMMENTARY 935-45

dental transposition, this had become una est lut. duorum, the change
una to prima was necessitated by the metre.]

936. One thing at least is clear with regard to this line ε nascentum
has no place in this context. Saturn has nothing to do with nascentes;
they belong to Mercury, cf. 539 sqq. But, if nascentes have nothing to
do with Saturn, senescentes have a great deal. nascentum atque
patrum represents an original scholion ‘senescentum atque patrum ’ in
explanation of duorum in 935. [Incidentally it becomes clear that the
last half of 935 is not (as Jacob and Breiter hold) spurious3 if there
had been no duorum in the text there would have been no senescentum
atque patrum in the margin.] The meaningless quae lali condita

pars est may be regarded as a mere stopgap for the defective versifica-
tion of nascentum atque patrum.

937. asper erit templis titulus: asperum codd.y involving an un-
Manilian elision: yet cf. ν. 375 ; for templis GL have tempus, which
is the same thing3 M has templum (templu), which is templis less its
final letter. For the plur. templis, of a single pars, see below 943
haec tua templa serunt. asperum erat tempus titulum cui, Bonin-
contrius, who comments thus: tempus quo filius Iuppiter expulit
patrem asperum erat. Bene, Bonincontri!

XVhen he speaks of asper titulus Manilius, under daemonium,
conceives of Saturn‚ as κακὸς δαίμων. For this title see Bouche-Leclercq‚

. 283, 285.
pp937—47. Regio Exortus: the tutela Mercuri, which presides over
births and the hopes of parents.

941. uiridis means quite simply ⁴ of the colour of the sea ' : cf. Ovid
Tristia i. 2. 59 pro superi uiridesque dei quibus aequora curae. Ellis
cites Dirae 142 sidera per uiridem redeunt cum pallida mundum
(where uiridis mundus = oceanus).

944 sqq. I think Ι have restored at least the general sense of these
perplexing and corrupt lines. ‘And you will perform, if you mark
births ' (which is the province of the Mercuri tutela), what the name
(of the regio, i.e. Horoscopus) and the founders of the art which (has)
conquered Olympus, assign to you.'

The MSS. in 944 offer osacies signata nota. Save et for o, notas
for nota, I have not changed a letter. And Statius Siluae ii. 7. 93 M
(our M ,be it understood: see Introduction, pp. xxv sqq.) has szgnalum
for sic natum. The spelling gnatum has attestation‚ in the earliest
MSS.: see Ribbeck’s Vergil, Prolegomena, p. 420 (1866); cf. Lucr.
iii. 29 sic natura A vancius: signatura codd. si nata nolas is suggested
to Manilius by Maia Cyllenie nate immediately preceding—the words
indeed support my correction.

nomen: i. e. ὡροσκόπος ; ὥρα = genitumst σκοπεῖν = signare.

In 945 ‘the art which conquered Olympus' is, of course, astrology
or astronomy; of which art Manilius, in the long exordium to his
poem, recognizes Mercury as the founder3 lu princeps auctorque sacri,
Cyllenie, tanti, δὶα, i. 30 sqq.; Diodorus i. 16. 1 φασὶ περί τε τῆς τῶν
ἄστρων τάξεως . . . τοῦτον πρῶτον γεγονέναι παρατηρητήν. See Schol. in
Germ. Arat. ad fin.

Of other emendations I know none save Jacob’s 9 (the symbol
for Venus; he means Φ ; the same error in Ellis, p. 76) for o in 944,
and Housman⁷s pro, of which the former is at any rate arresting. But
after all Q is merely a symbol, a shorthand; and (1) ‘a word does not
become a monosyllable because it is written in shorthand ' (E. J. u'ebb,
C. R. xi, p. 310); and (2) ‘as Letronne fifty years ago maintained,
