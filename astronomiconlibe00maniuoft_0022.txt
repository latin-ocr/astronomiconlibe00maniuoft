INTRODUCTION 1

by Breiter, and Thielscher¹ has recently examined it afresh
throughout. I arn indebted to the last named sor the loan of his
collation of Book 11. Upon this collation my Apparatus Criticus
depends.

sps, once in the Escurial Monastery, now in the N ational Library at
'Madrid (31), belongs to the beginning of the fifteenth century. Its
readings were'first made known, and appraised, by R. Ellis? But
fourteen years before Ellis published his collation M had been dis-
covered and collated by Loewe. Loewe's collation‚ however, did
not see the light till 1907, when, together with Ellis’, it was used by
Breiter for his edition. Between Ellis and Loewe there were, as
was inevitable, a certain number of discrepancies.3 In 1908 I asked
Mr. C. E. Stuart, of T rinity College‚ Cambridge, to examine M sor
rne in those places where Ellis and Loewe differed. This he was
kind enough to do, and to put at my disposal his notes of the
result:¹ ΙΙΙ has, however, been collated afresh by Thielscher and
K. Ziegler,¹ and it is to be hoped that they will publish any new
results of their examinatior] of it.⁵ Meanwhile Thielscher has for
Book II generously supplied me with notes upon the readings of
those passages where Ellis, Loewe, and Stuart left me still
doubtful.

GLMss all three, go back ultimately to a common ancestor (A),
of which Ι shall presently speak in detail. At present it is suffi-
cient to say that editors are agreed that this MS„ A, contained
44 lines to the folium (22 lines to the page). But GL are
descended from A through an ancestor which they do not share
with M. This ancestor Ι will call α. α was a MS. of saec. ix-xi,
containing 38 lines to the page, written in double columns. Clear
traces of this lineation are preserved in Books III and IV. 111. 37
is followed in GL by ΙΙΙ. 7. This means that III. 7 was omitted
from its proper place and inserted as the last line of a page of
38 lines (37÷titulus). Again, IV. 731—2 are omitted by GL‚⁵

⁶ It is true that 731 and 733 begin with the same word, addc3 but even
omissions so caused occur most easily at the end of a page.
