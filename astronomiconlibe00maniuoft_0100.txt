INTRODUCTION 111

in the past deserved well of Manilius.¹ Breiter's death, which fol-
lowed close upon the publication os his Commentary‚ is a real
missortune. For he was for half a century a high example os con-
tinued devotion to obscure and unrewarded studies,

Bechert's text—in the English Corpus Poetarmn-is valuable
not so much for itself as forits Apparatus. The text itself is based
upon critical presuppositions now generally recognized as false;
and in some places it would even seem to have been framed in
a spirit of deliberate contrariety. The Apparatus, however, in-
cluding as it does—and as Breiter's does not——the principal con·
jectures of editors, is, despite some odd omissions‚ the best that
exists. Owing, however, to the fact that it forms part of a large
and unwieldy volume Bechert's edition can never be very usable.
The same scholar's dissertation in [aspa-eger Studien, 1878,
pp. 3—61, goes deep and is usefu13 but, on the subject of the
Manilian archetype, it 15,2 in the main, Ι think, wrong.

Of Manilian scholars in this country who are still living it would
be unbecoming that I should speak save with some reserve.
Foremost among them is Ellis, who, if 1 may say so, stands to
Bentley somewhat as Huet to Scaliger, though naturally his posi-
tive services to Manilius are greater than Huet’s. His Noctes
Manffisznae constitutes a sharp and shrewd attack upon Bentley,
yet with a fair recognition of Bentley's brilliant qualities. When
he wrote the Noctes Ellis had not yet discovered sllalritenst's, and
this, for present-day criticism, imposes a limitation on parts of his
book. But the work as a whole is indispensable to the student
of Manilius. Perhaps no recent editor brings so much un-
borrowed learning to the task of interpreting the Astronomzka.
Some of his emendations, as I. 582 limes for timens, I. 723
nondum for mmzdnm, will take their place in all subsequent
texts.

Postgate’s Silua sllam’liana, to some extent a counterblast to
Ellis' Abctes, is a work which may be read not only with profit
but—what is more remarkable in so difficult a subject—without

¹ Occasional notes, as ΙΙ. 788, are admirable. roth text and commentar)-
are praised discreetly by Moeller, Berl. Phil. Woclz, 1910, pp. 493-9.
Norden (Einle1·t1mgi.d. Allertumswt'ssensclmft, i, p. 569) speaks os them as
‘vollig unbrauchbar'. Yet Kleingt'inther in D. L.Z.. 1908, pp. 2077—81,
writes: ¹ Durch ihren hohen wissenschaftlichen Wert tritt Br.⁷s Ausgabe
den Arbeiten Scaligers, Bentleys und Pingres wlirdig zur Seite '.
