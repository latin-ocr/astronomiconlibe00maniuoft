contempt a science to which the past and the present alike bear
a glorious testimony.'

The passage has the eloquence of a certain pathetic hesitancy.
And this hesitancy is probably typical of many of the best minds‚
not only of the Tacitean period, but os the whole period of the
early Principate. These hesitant sentences of Tacitus are the
best commentary that we could have upon the whole spirit of the
Astronomt'ca. It is this hesitancy which is the opportunity of
Manilius. He flings himself upon it in an ardour of absolute
personal conviction. The last of the poets to feel the impulsion
of the furor arduus of philosophie speculation‚ he addresses him-
self with arresting insistency to men in whom the age-long fact of
social and moral confusion had wellnigh killed saith in an order
of the universe. It is true that many parts of his poem reflect the
unrest and bewilderment of the times in which he lived. He does
not wholly escape the infections of his age. He inherits‚ like his
contemporaries, the shaken nerves of the Civil War.¹ On the
other hand he has, as his contemporaries have not, an unconquer-
able conviction of the paramountcy of Reasong and this con-
viction‚ informing every line os his poem, makes that poem sor
us somewhat of a literary paradox. We had heard of an astro-
loger, and we looked for a quack or an imbecile. Yet the most
striking impressions that we receive from the reading of the
.-lstr0uomica are undoubtedly those of a rare purity of mind in its
author and a singular freedom from superstition. Indeed‚ in his
signal detachment from superstition, and in the lofty expression
which he gives to this freedom, Manilius is the peer of Lucretius,
Reason, he tells us, has ascended into heaven,

eripuitque Ioui fulmen uiresque Tonanti (Ι. 103-4):

it has freed the human mind from empty fears and interpreted
natural phenomena as such. God, it is true, is in all these
phenomena, but not any god of pagan mythology: rather that
God who is reason and spirit and law (ΙΙ. 60 sqq). ‘ For I will
sing of the silent strong workings of nature, and of God interfused
in earth and sky and sea controlling in impartial covenant the
mighty mass of things. Ι will sing how the whole universe is
alive with harmony upon this side and upon that, and is moved
by the motions os Reason, one spirit indwelling in all its parts,
