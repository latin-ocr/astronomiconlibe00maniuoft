COMMENTARY 374—86

Bouche- -Leclercq strangely takes tertia as the signs of a quadrangle,

p 17i10221⁰uers0†· . conue7so MSS„ which Breiter thinks it possible to
defend as ‘ durch das Zuriicktreten des Bogens ². But recessu = ‘das

Zuriicktreten ⁹, and how are we to get ‘ des Bogens ' out of conuerso ?
Yet connexo, the commonly accepted correction, is made somewhat
suspicions by the recurrence of the same word in the next line.
conuerso has perhaps displaced some such word as secreto.

375. et quia: so M, and to this the et qu of L1 points, though
Breiter prefers G’s et quae; ‘and because the line (of the hexagon)
approaches near to the concave heaven, in such a way as to pass by
singula astra (non- -alternate signs), the vision of the hexagonal stars
is distant from earth and wanders in high Olympus!

376. singula non· -alternate as at 361, where praecludens :quae
transeat here.

377. uisus eis: so Ven. (Bentley) for uis eius of MSS. uis . . .
mittit uires is intolerable, surely3 and for uisus cf. 3 52-7 (the converse
of the present case), and note there, where eff’ctus = uires here; Plin.
Ν. H. ii. 41. 110 stellas insignes efficlu uisuue.

379. sub lege propinqua : sub cognatione sexus, Du Fay, rightly.

380. †quod euntibus†: Scaliger interprets euntibus by ordine
z'ucedentzbus, secundum ordznem suum, altering sed 1n 381 to sex, and
se coni'ungunt 1n 382 to sex conzungunt (sex conuenerunt is found already
in Bonincontrius). We may allow to Scaliger the merit of being the
first editor to offer a text which will at least construe—the Edd. Velt.
are plainly untranslatable. But it was left for Bentley to lay his finger
upon the real seat of the corruption. Bentley saw at once that quod
euntibus was impossible—though his own aller'nantzbus has no
probability3 and at the same time he corrected se conzungunt (383)
with certainty to secum zungffunt Breiter and Ellis follow Bentley' in
locating the principal corruption at quod euntibus. Breiter, emending
to subeuntibus, gives to subeunlzbus the same force as he postulates
for subeuntia at 371, where see note. Ellis suggests coeuntibus =
alternis se coniungentibus. But coeuntibus astris will mean merely
‘allied stars ’, as iv. 301 in se coeuntibus astris ; and it is not true to say
ἁπλῶς that allied stars are of the same sex. In this case they are,
because we are dealing with a specific sort of allied stars; but
coeuntzbus astrzs does not give their specific sort

381-2. Breiter accepts Scaliger's sex mm zbus and sex contungunt.
But (1) Ellis' note on sed maribus is decisive: sed aperte wspondet
parmulae non (380)· , while (2) Bentley' s et noto secum: lzoc est
femznea cum femznezs, non cum masculis might have given pause
even to an editor careless of rhythm.

383. sic quamquam alternis: quanquam (for MSS. quicquam)' 1s
due to Bentley: quanquam alterna sunt, quod obest ,prodest tamen quod
cognata sunt. Breiter retains quchuam (with paret) as = ‘to some
extent' ‘Sprachlich auffallig ‚’ he says; ancl so in all conscience
it is.

paret natura figuris: natum, not ‘’nature (the figurae obey
‘ nature', not conversely), but‘ sex’ ,as 411. figuris = σχηματισμοῖς,
Scaliger, · perhaps merely = segnis cf. 454.

385-90. There is no consensus between signs which are next to
one another.

385. haerentibus: i.q.ui'‘c1nzs.

386. nam consensus, hebet quia uisus, ademptus. Ι have here
