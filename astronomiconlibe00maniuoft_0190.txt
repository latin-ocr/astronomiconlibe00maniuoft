11 165—76 COMMENTARY

164—5. his = Geminis, illis = Piscibus, while haec in 167 = et
Pisces et Gemini.

165-6. alia sunt respicientia se, ut Gemini, alia auersantia,
Scaliger.

165. in contraria uersis: alter enim βόρειος, alter νότιος, Scaliger.

166. par numerus: sc. Piscium.

167. toto gaudentia censu: explained by what follows; both
(1) unimpaired in form, (2) sels-sufficient; they are not διφυῆ.

169-70. quaedam quod : the construction is quod dolent et
mirantur quaedam (signa) quae sunt parte recisa et membris ex
diuerso corpore commissis.

amissumue in 169 is a necessary correction of admissumque,
being paralleled with parte recisa. Yet Jacob, followed by Breiter,
retains admissumque, placing after it a semi-colon. He then explains
the clause dolent quaedam quod as = quaedam dolent quod parte
recisa sunt, δὶα-οἱ which Ellis rightly says mire errauit Iacobus.
Breiter offers no explanation.

170. commissis: at Germ. Arai. 414-15 ‘sunt etiam flammis
commissa immania membra Centauri' Burmann conjectured stant
. . . commissi (perhaps ‘ sunt etiam humanis commissa ’, &c.).

173-4. alta in 173 is, I believe, corrupt; and in 174 I have altered
duplane to duplicine (as 188). But I see no convincing reason for
obelising the two lines. quoque in 173 need present no difficulty3
‘ this distinction as well as the distinction between singula and bina,
humana and serina, &c.’ The two lines sum up (and such summing-
up couplets are in Manilius’ manner) the nature of the distinction
illustrated by the preceding six lines. A constellation, like Pisces,
consisting of two paria corpora is to be carefully distinguished from
a constellation, such as Sagittarius, consisting of one corpus diuersis
membris. ξὺζυγα are one thing, διφυῆ another.

175 sqq. Erigone: all the tropic signs save Libra are preceded by
a binum signum ; Cancer by Gemini, Capricorn by Sagittarius,
Aries by Pisces. Accordingly, lest any tropic sign should not be pre-
ceded by a binum signum, Virgo, who precedes Libra, binis numeratur
in astris, is counted as a binum signum. She is ratione duplex (176),
‘cfiouble according to reason '—for the pure reason insists on this kind
o symmetry.

176. ( 1) The text os the MSS. nec facie, ratio duplex cannot be
sound, though Ellis defends it; for ratio duplex cannot be explained by
the following words: since desinit . . . incipit constitute together only
one ratio, viz. ratio situs3 (2) for the same reason hoc faciet ratio
duplex (Regiomontanus) is wrong; (3) Bentley's et facie et ratione
duplex is more obviously wrong than anything else. Is Virgo is double
both facie and ratione then she is in just the same case as Sagittarius,
which Manilius clearly means to say that she is not. It is true, as
Bentley points out, that at 661 Manilius has duplicemque in Virgine
formam; and it is true that Erigone is winged, and might therefore,
strictly speaking, corne under the class of διφυῆ. But (1) Virgo retains
her distinctive humanity in a way in which e. g. Sagittarius does not.
The wings, so to speak, hardly matter. We do not, to take an analogy,
think of Cupicl (despite Browning's ‘ Lyric Love half-angel and half-
bird ‘)‚ or of Mercury, as half-bird3 (2) at 660 sqq. where Manilius
speaks of duplicem in Viqgine firmam he also reckons Pisces and
Gemini among duplici conexa figura, which is exactly what in our
present passage we are told they are not. The Centaur also is said to
