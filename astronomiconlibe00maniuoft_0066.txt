INTRODUCTION III

Augustus in the same Book it is impossible to interpret these
lines as implying that Augustus is dead. Ellis and others aptly
compare Hor. C. iii. 3. 11-12, ‘quos inter Augustus recumbens
purpureo bibit ore nectar ’—where the variant bibet has tempted
nobody—in which Augustus, still lae'zing, is figured as already
sitting among the Gods. So Manilius here figures him already
ruling the heaven as the partner in empire of Jove. (IV. 933-5‚
cited by Ellis, is more doubtful 3 see beloxv.) The corrections
replebit, reget, cernet are intolerably flat. (In 801 for magnumque
I would suggest agnoultque.)

From II. 507—8‚ where it is said that Capricom beholds
himself, ‘for what nobler sight could he look upon since it was
he that shone on the rising of Augustus?''—it is once again clear
that Augustus is still living. Our real difficulties lie in Book IV,
since ΙΙΙ and V contain no indications of date. At IV. 243-8
we are told of Capricom, Augustus’ star, that he presides over the
discovery and working of gold, sssver, and iron, the baking of
bread, the buying and selling of warm clothes, and that, from his
position, he is the cause of instability in things and fluctuation of
mind in men. The first clauses might pass for a not ungraceful
reference to useful and beneficent works of Augustus, and the
reference to instability and fluctuation, though it impliae no
compliment to Augustus, is—viewed as a hostile criticism—so
strikingly untrue as to be silly. ‘But of kings and Kesars,’ says
Mr. Housman, ‘not a word.·' Worse yet, in 529 sq. we have
‘ Veneri m'uzto cum crimine seruit pars prior, at melior iuncto sub
pisce senecta est⁷2 ‘these words, with their spice of truth and
personality, were hardly written of Augustus' star in Augustus’
lifetime.² This is ingeniously argued, and perhaps tru1y,1 though
it would be possible in ‘Veneri mino cum crimine seruit,' &Q to
see a reference to Julia 3 nor was it easy for Manilius in speaking
of the caper side of Capricom to avoid allusion to the propensity
of capri for Veneris crimina: yet ‘at melior . . . senecta' is a
poor apology to Augustus.

‘ Instead of Capricom it is now Libra that assumes the primacy
of heaven* (Housman). This is undeniably true. But Mt.
Housman proceeds to argue: Capricom and not Libra was the
