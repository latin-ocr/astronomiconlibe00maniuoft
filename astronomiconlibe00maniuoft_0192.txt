ΙΙ 188-95 COMMENTARY

is a double sign but with the fact that he is a tropic sign. (The sense
which Ellis gives to sub is, of course, distinctively Manilian.) 1 fancy
that sub ipso promittit means little more than in se promittit, ‘ on the
occasion of his own appearance,' the prep. being used as at v. 231 nec
tales mirere artes sub sidere tali.

188. fertur: ‘est represent& Pingui, giving a false point. No,
Virgo ‘est representee' is said to be a double sign, Capricorn is one.
fertur: ‘moves '—of the φορά of the οὐρανός, as Catullus lxii. 20
Hespere, qui caelo fertur crudelior {gnis ,ἲ Cic. A rat. Fr. 3 (Baehrens);
Germ. 449, 578, &e

190. hominis: oris codd.; and oris at 172 all save M. It seems to
me nothing but perversity in Breiter that he reads hominis there
and refuses to clo so here (hominis = 527 = oris). Retaining oris he
explains the construction as = molles artus, molliorem materiam
oris!

fera tergo, &a ‘ Sa croupe herissee de poils,’ Pingre, incorrectly,
sor this would require tergore; tergum, despite Seneca T lzy. 228, and
some lexicons‚ never means ‘ hair’. artus serini quos habet a tergo,
Du Fay, inexactly. tergo goes with excipiunt.

191. munciamquer in tempora signum. The true reading is
probably past recovery. mittuntque (most edd.) I do not understand.
‘Annonce le commencement (de l'hiver>‚' Pingr63 apparently after
Scaliger, who takes signum mittere as though of the praetor who
signum mittendi currus dat. Scaliger's note is not intelligible. Du F ay
pronounces it nugae, but offers nugae himself when he renders pro-
mouent illud signum in duo diuersa tempora. No other interpreta-
tions are offered in any book known to me.

Breiter's nutatque is at least an improvement on mittuntque3
but nutare is an odd expression of Sagittarius. Jacob's mutantque
means nothing 3 fera terga Sagittari mutant signum ( = Sagittarium)
in tempora! The corruption probably extends beyond nunciamque.
in tempora looks as though it had come from the line following.

193. dicant: ⁶ ont rapport a‚’ Pingre, evasively; ‘ beanspruchen fiir
sich,' Breiter‚ as though dtco was uindico. dico is a favourite word of
Manilius, e. g. i. 600 diuisosque semel fines sortemque dicatam5 ii. 4 35
et quae (signa) cuique deo rerum natura dicauit; iii. 453 Tauri signo
pars sexta dicanda; iv. 855 spatium quod cuique dicatum v. 363-4
caeloque dicatum alituum omne genus. (At ii. 887 the text is uncer-
tain.) In all these passages dico is i. q. tribuo, ‘assign’; just as at
Verg. Aen. i. 73 propriamque dicabo. But to whom, or what, do the
duo Pisces here assign bina tempora?

In the way of emendation nothing better has been proposed than
the dabunt of Regiomont.‚serunt os Dulcinius (Scal.¹, Du Fay).

lf the text is sound, dicant must, I think, be an archaism for
indicant, and so I have, doubtfully, rendered it in my translation.
Nonius 287 explains dicare as = nuntiare. Lucilius, Book XXX, has
Fama tuam pugnam dicasset3 and the MSS. of Catullus at lxiv. 227
give dicet, where, if sound, it can only mean ‘ declare ’ ; uide Ellis ad
loc. Against this interpretation must be set, of course, the constant
use in Manilius of dico = tribuo.

hiemem hic claudit, Bentley, too hastily. Cf. L. δε S. s. v.
alter.
