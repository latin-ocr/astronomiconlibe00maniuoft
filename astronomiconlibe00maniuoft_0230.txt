11 536-41 COMMENTARY

weaker than those born under, say, Libra? 537-9 for the serina
szjgna remam, in heaven, vanquished and inferior (as they were on
earth) to the segna humana. The argument is: the serina were
conquered and conquerable when they were upon earth. Will not
those on earth whom they protect be conquered and conquerable
likewise? Surely 503 for the firz'na themselves in heaven now, as
on earth before, are conquered and conquerable. 537-9 are thus
indispensable to the logie of what Manilius is saying. Now try and
insert between these three lines (537-9) and 535 the line (536) which
I have bracketed. You get this result: ‘The ferina were conquered
on earth: will not those on earth whom they protect be conquered
likewise? Moreover, we must follow a breuior ratio through the
szg’ns. For the ferina themselves in heaven now, as on earth before,
abide conquered!

Clearly 536 has no place in this argument, nor in the text at
this point.

541-69. In 520—38 Manilius has laid it down that the signs of
alternate triangles are, conjunctly, hostile. But (a) this hostility of
triangle to triangle does not necessarily and always involve each
individual sign in war with each individual sign of the hostile triangle3
(b) individual signs have enemies outside the signs of the triangle
alternate to their own. Manilius' scheme seems to be as follows :—

1. The individua] signs of alternate triangles are throughout
mutually hostile, save that in the fourth triangle Scorpion and Pisces
are not attacked by the signs of the second triangle.

2. A11¹ the ferine signs are attacked by Virgo and Libra (save
that Virgo does not attack her own triangle).

3. Virgo, Libra, Scorpion, Pisces are all attacked by the signs ot
their own square.

4. Scorpion is attacked by all the human signs.

The scheme involves, in fact, four principles determining enmity :
(1) triangular alternatim, (2) sex, (3) species—human, bestial,
(4) quadrangular situation.

The following table will give at a glance the enmities of the
various signs. That the mathematical grouping may be seen, Ι employ
numbers to designate the signs: Aries = 1, Taurus = 2, and
so on 1-

The text of this perplexed passage has been endlessly emended.
My own corrections do not extend beyond an obelus at 553 and the
assumption of a lost line after 562. (ln addition Ι have, with most
editors, at 542 and 552 accepted corrections of Bentley.) Yet I have,
as 1 believe, left this passage intelligible and consistent, a result which
the many emendations of previous editors have failed to achieve.
