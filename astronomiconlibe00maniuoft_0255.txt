COMMENTARY 872-87

to perish in the neighbouring cardo (the cardo below it, O. C. C.) or to
fall if robbed of its support?

No editor, Ι think, has seized the sense of these three lines. All
have interpreted Manilius as though he had written lzaec praeceps metuit
uicino cardine finem, illa supina pendens fraudata uicino cardine cadet.
But no : Manilius’ description of regio iz' ends at praeceps lmen
illa . . . cadet is all part of the description of regio viii, Regio viii
fears either to set in the Ο. C. C., or, if deprived of the prop ofO. C. C.‚
to fall utterly into I. M. C.

Du Fay, Pingrei, Bouche-Leclercq‚ Breiter all make the subject of
metuit to be regio ii, and are then obliged to take uicino cardine of
Hor. ‘ apprehende d'etre ecrasee par la maison orientale '‚ Pingre.

supina, ‘giving,’ ‘ ready to sink,' ‘weak.’ 1 have retained the
reading of Μ, which is, I think, sufficiently defended by Catullus
xvii. 4 ne supinus eat (ponticulus) cauaque in palude recumbat,
where supinus means, not ὕπτιος, as Ellis, but what in English is called,
of boats and the like, ‘ buckhng!

uicino: i. q. inferiore, as often in Manilius.

876. nec matre minores: so many roods did these giants cover,
they are said to be as big as Earth which bare them.

877. in altum: in profundum terrae. Perhaps in aluum, ⁶ to the
womb of Earth.'

878. et super cadentes rediere montes : i. e. eos, ut in altum
ceciderunt, montes obruebant.

h 879. ἑ And Typhoeus passed reluctant to the grave of himself and
is war are.’

881—2. The regio ‘which follows, and is next to, the summits os the
shining heaven ’, next to M. C., is the eleventh regio.

882. uix ipsi cedat: ‘would scarce yield to that star whereto it is
neighbour‚’ i. e. to the M. C. astro = planetae = Veneri, the planet
being here put for the regio which it governs.

uix (nec = nex GL) is due to Bentley (ᾸΓΞ non is a bad inter-
polation). jacob and Breiter retain the MS. reading. ‘ qui fungitur
astro: cardo (he means cardine) qui praesens regnat? Jacob; ‘qui
fungitur: juppiter, unter dessen Tutel dieser Ort stelzt‚’ Breiter;
and Manilius, like Typhoeus, turns in his grave.

cui iungitur, Huet, rightly, for quz'fimgitur.

astro can scarcely be interpreted of the planet Jupiter cui
iungitur, to which is assigned regio xi (so, with fingitur = adfingitur,
ΕΙΗῧ), since the point is that this regio scarcely yields to the fastigium
itse .

883. spe melior : sc. quam priorem so 884 altius sc. quam
priores.

885. in peiusque manent cursus: in peiusque cursus, of course,
together; ‘there is left for it only a progress to a position that is still
inferior ’—-to that of the fastigimn.

887. inferior : so the edd. vett. rightly for MSS. interior. integrior,
Housman, perversely (which if it means minus periculo obnoxia is not
even Latin).

The construction is: minime mirum est, si (= si quidem, εἵπεμ,
seeing that) proxima summo eademque ueneranda sorte (= fastigii
sorte, M. C.) inferior locatur, quod titulus filix. Felix is the natural
title of a sors so situated.

ueneranda sorte : abl. of comparison after inferior. The
ueneranda sors is the M.C. lt is called ueneranda (1) because that
