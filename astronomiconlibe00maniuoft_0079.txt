MANILIUS AND HIS EDITORS

aid of Manilius' poem as we possess it. Consequently the Astro-
uomica is an entirely harmless composition. The sting os astrology
is the planets. The Astronomica is astrology without its sting.
The Scorpion has hidden his claws under Libra or political
prudence. In other words, I suppose Manilius to have begun
his poem—indeed to have proceeded some way with it—in the
full intention of expounding in detail the influence of the planets.
After the edict os A. D. 16 he deliberately finished it off without
this exposition. Indications of the larger primary conception
remain standing because, though in one sense the poem was
finished, in another sense it was not. Manilius finished his poem
in so far as to complete a rough draft of the whole. He did not
finish it in so far as he never went through it to remove its minor
blemishes and inconsistencies.

This view—which is of course provisional only—sits in with the
fact that Manilius is so much neglected both before and after the
Middle Ages.¹ One is inclined to explain this neglect by saying
that he is hard and dull. He is hard and dull to most persons
to-day. But that is because most persons to-day have little know-
ledge of, and no interest in, astrology. But the men of the first

’ sive centuries‚ and again of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries‚

were made differently. To them astrology was interestmg and
respectable. It was just because Manilius did not deal with the
planets, because he does not help any one to cast a horoscope,
because, that is, he wrote five ² books and not ‘viii uolumina' or
any other number, that he was so long so utterly neglected.

The Astronomica, then, never received its author's ultima
manus. It remains a rather incoherent composition, often obscure
alike in thought and diction. Yet, despite its many blemishes,
it is a poem not altogether unworthy in style and tone of a place
beside the greater literary monuments of the Augustan age. For
a genuine vein of poetry runs all through it—in a rather broken
thread no doubt. Moral elevation alone perhaps cannot make

1 The view of the Middle Ages is clearly expressed in Ambrosiaster’s
dictum: ‘ Nihil tarn contrarium est Christiano quarn si arti matheseos
adhibeat curam.’ For its legal formulation see Cod. Theocl. 9. 16. 4 3
9. 16. 6.

² lt seems to me likely, though no one has made the suggestion, that the
numberfive was determined for Manilius by the number of the planets : just
as Firmicus regarded his eight books as i ÷ vii (seven planets) 3 Mallzesis, viii.
33 ‘hos libros ad septem stellarum ordinem numerumque conpositos '.
