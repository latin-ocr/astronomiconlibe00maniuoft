COMMENTA RY 861-8

cogit. The mnndi natura has no fines proprii—its fines are every-
where—but the signs have.

863. poenam referentia: poenamque ferentia codd. Similarly at
Seneca Med. 366 regnum referens (codd.) for regnumque ferens
(Madvig).

864—970. Manilius has spoken of the four cardines, and of the four
interualla which separate them from one another. He now proceeds,
dividing each of the four zntemalla into two regiones (ἑπαναφορά
and ἐπικαταφορά (ἀπόκλιμιι)), and reckoning each cardo as one reg zo,
to explain which of the different regzenes are fortunate, and which
unfortunate3 and, again, which deities pleside in each.

F] om 8’64- 917 Manilius speaks of the eight regzones of the znler-
ualla- ‚ and from 918—70 of the four regzoms of the cmdz'nes themselves.
Breiter holds that these four regiones of the cardines are nothing more
than the four cardinal points themselves. It is clear (from 842—3) that
down to 855 Manilius has been speaking of cardinal p02·nts; and from
there to the end he all through according to Breiter, ‘h'alt die cardines
als Punkte fest! This view seems to me perverse. For (1) it leaves

unexplained the duplicate treatment, 808 40÷918 sqq„ of the influences
of the cardinal poinpts. (Breiter, if I understand him, assumes Manilius
in 808— 404918 sqq. to be drawing upon two different‘ sources', with-
out perceiving that he was saying the same thing twice over. We
have met this kind of hypothesis before); (2) elsewhere, e. g. Firmicus
and the A strol Cat„ the car dznes are co'n'ceived as regzones and not as
points merely· , (3) Breiter' s xiew is only a more insidious form os an
older view which he himself combats. It reduces the twelve loci to
ὀκτὼ τόποι; for if the cardinal regiones are points, then clearly-how-
ever much we call them regiones—-they are not regiones in the sense
in which the other eight loci are. Even granting that you are left with
twelve regiones, yet these split up into two systems‚ 8 ψ 4.

But that the ὀκτὼ τόποι are a mere figment no one is more con-
vinced than Breiter himself. We may here conveniently dismiss this
figment in a very few words: (1) It has its origin in 968-70, which
betray, both by their matter and their language, that they are an
interpolation, · see note ad loc. (2) No other writer knows of a system
of ὀκτὼ τόποι-1116 octo loci of Firmicus are different. (3) There is
nothing anywhere in 864- 970 to show that Manilius was conscious
that at 918 he was entering on a different system. The loci of 918 sqq.
are treated as precisely on a par with those of 864—917. (4) There are
twelve athla in Book ΙΙΙ.

Bouche-Leclercq defends doubtfully the view that Manilius recog-
nizes an eightsold division of the Circle. But he is prepaied to see
(apparently' 1n the whole of 864- 70 ?) the work of an interpolator. For
various explanations of the origin of this eightfold division see his note,
p. 271.

864. quae super exortum: the twelfth regzo.
867-70. par erit: the regio diametrically opposed—the sixth.
868. iuncta sub occasu : ‘next to and beneath O. C. C.’

uel praestite cardine mundi: ‘even though a cardo watches
over it, each is called deiecta because each threatens disaster.’
Ι have written uel for neu : praestite is due to Jacob.

praestite ε almost uicino (873) ; abl. absol. in both cases.

Jacob quotes Firmicus ii. 20 loca ngra et deiecta esse dicuntur,
quod nulla cum horoscopo societate iungantur. In our present
passage uel praestite cardine mundi . . . fertur deiecta = ⁴ nulla
