COMMENTARY 446-53

ex Iouis aduerso betrays the principle of diametrical arrange-
ment governing Manilius' catalogue. Jupiter-Juno, Pallas-Vulcan‚
Venus· Mars, Phoebus· Diana, Mercury- -Vesta, Ceres· -Neptune are all
pairs of opposites.

447. aequore: Bentley in a highly sophistical note proposes aethere.

agnoscitque su0s= Verg. Aen. iii. 347· Ov. Ales. v. 212

449. stellas et sidera: ‘pl mels and Zodiacal signs,’ since the god-
heads which have just been said to influence the Zodiacal signs are,
many os them, planetary godheads—though Manilius, in his work as
we have it, nowhere treats planetary astrology. See Introduction,

. lxxii.
p 453—65. Each member of the human body is under the tulela of
a particular Zodiacal sign.

The scholiast on Aratus 544 attributes the invention of‘ Zodiacal
Melothesia’ to ‘the Egyptians‘ (the‘ Chaldean’ origin which Sext
Empiricus claims for it means nothing3 for to Sext. Empiricus all
astrologers are ‘Chaldeans ’;) and to theo Egyptian Priest- -as- -Medicine-
Man we may plausibly assign the origin of the whole system of
giatromathematic'‚ of which this passage of Manilius is a wandering
ragment.

Manilius' Melothesia (which is reproduced in Paulus Alexan-
drinus, Porphyrius, Firmicus, and Sextus Empiricus, and seems to have
been known to St. Augustine—-Haeres 70) is highly primitive in con-
ception. The human body is outstretched and, as it were, rolled
round, or wrapped about, the Zodiacal Circle‚ in such a way that the
head rests on Aries, the feet on Pisces ; the intervening signs receive
the other parts in order, as Taurus the neck, Gemini the shoulders and
arins, &03 detail in notes foll. (See also Boll, sphaera, pp. 471-2.)

453-6. The grave difficulties which belong to these lines are met on
the part os commentators by a discreditable conspiracy of silence.
Few of them have any note at all, none suggest any doubts. My own
rendering (in the Translation) is given hesitatingly3 and the following
points call for comment :—

(1) Scaliger ², Junius, Stoeber seem right in taking parentia at
454 as = {amparentia ( parent in mgna, Scaliger ¹, taking parent z'n as
oboediunt ;

(2) figuris cannot here mean the human shape; it seems rather
to stand, as perhaps at 383, merely for ςιξηίη

(3) The antecedent to quis in 455 is neither figurzs as Du Fay—
for the members do not exercise power in the stars‚ but mee uersa3 and
Du Fay is further at once refuted by iv. 700 zn quibus assement
praestantes sidera mres (cf. the whole of 1v. 696-710), as well as by
iv. 808 q.v.-—nor‚ again, membra, as Pingre (whose rendering involves
an impossible distortion of the order of words in 454) ; but sar rather
hominis partes in 453, line 454 being, so far as the construction is con-
cerned, a mere amplifying parenthesis 3

(4) From this it follows that the subject of exercent in 456 is
sidera in 4 ;

(5) Thie3meaning of praecipuas toto de corpore uires seems to
be settled by the parallel in iv. 700. It means no more than does there
praestantes m'res; it means, that is, ‘especial’ or ‘pre—eminent’
powers; but the ‘ especial' character of the powers is here given pre-
cisely by saying that they are ‘especial’ toto de corpore; they are
powers proper to that particular part, out of the whole body, which
belongs to a given sign.
