10-11. See Quintilian, x. 1. 46. Bonincontrius compares Ovid Am. iii.
9. 2 5-6a quo . . . uatum Pieriis ora rigantur aquis. For the metaphor
in prose cf. Vell. Patere. i. 17 ingenia ex Socratico ore dffluentia.
‘ And into little channels cut his stream, Rich in his store' (Creech).
12. Hesiodus: 12-18 the Theogony: quin etiarn in 19 introduces
the WVorks and Days. The whole passage 12-24 has been, however,
the subject of considerable controversy. The discrepancy between the
extant Theogonz‘a and Erga and the Manilian was noted by Scaliger
(see notes following). Scaliger sought to explain it by supposing that
Manilius had confused the Hesiodic and the Orphic Erga (p. 103)—
a view refuted by Lobeck Aglaoplz. i. 418. Others have supposed that
Manilius had before him a Hesiodic Theogony of which ours is
an abridgement, and the so-called fllegala Erga. Others again have
postulated the use (see 1. 18) of the Hesiodic Astrologia mentioned by
Pliny. These views may be seen briefly discussed in Mure, Gk. Lit.
ii, App. K, pp. 501 sqq., App. M, pp. 504 sqq. (I have not found the
subject elsewhere treated in English.) The problem is interesting to
students of Virgil as well as of Manilius and Hesiod. Some sensible
remarks upon it are to be found in Heyne’s Virgil, vol. i, 1830, pp. 275
sqq. The view that Manilius employed a (genuinely Hesiodic) Megala
Erga and Astrologia has for its principa] advocate the Catholic
theologian J. L. Hug, who published in 1835 a doctorial thesis entitled
Erga lilegala (Friburgi Brisgouiae). Hug's thesis is criticized at length
by Julius Caesar in Zimmermann’s Z ez'tsclzrz'ft fiir die Altertumswissen-
schgft, 1838, N os. 65—7‚ pp. 529—51 ( {seber das angebliclze Gedz'clzt
vem Landbau und die ‘zvlegala Erga' des Hesiod). An excellent
re'sume' of the whole question is given in Marckscheffel Hes. Fragm.
1840, pp. 203-15. Most persons will feel it unlikely that Manilius

our Τ lzeog. and our Erga, may also have had before him the now lost

This work was undoubtedly already extant in the time of Zeno ¹ (see
Diog. Laert. viii. 1. 25, 48 = von Arnim i. 2763 Rzach Hes. Fr. 254).

Plutarch Pytlz. Orac. 18, ἐξ 402-3, and Pliny N. H. xviii. 25. 213, and

genuineness. Schol. Arat. 254, Schol. Erga 382, Tzetzes Chz'l. xii.
