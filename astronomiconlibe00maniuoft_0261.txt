COMMENTARY 965-70

audiv, 298 quam partem—both interpolations) 3 but ‘ when the planets
assert their allotted influence ’ς the planets are a certa pars in a system

which demands partium mixtura.

968-70. Breiter rightly regards these lines as an interpolation.
(1) The usage of parti in 968 is un-Manilian; (2) the founder of
astronomy qui condidit artem hardly gave a Greek name to this pars:
even as Mercury he is Egyptian3 (3) Octotropos: probably a blunder
for oct0t0p051. But (a) octotopos is an adjective, masc. sing. ; (b) 0⁶·th-
topos involves a false quantity; (c) octo topos gets rid of the false
quantity, but it makes Manilius employ a phrase of which one half is
Latin and the other Greek—and that a phrase straight from the
founder of astrology! (d) it is pretty clear from quod that our inter-
polator took aetatepos as one word and as acc. neut. ; (e) ‘ mirum uero
ὀκτάτοπον dici quae omnino δωδεκάτοπος sit ⁷, says Scaliger; to which
Bouche-Leclercq rejoins aptly ‘ s’etonner n’est pas expliquer '. On this
see note at 864. (4) diuersa uolantes in 969 is at least doubtful
Latinity. On the whole question see Breiter’s note.

NOTE ΟΝ THIELSCHER'S COLLATION OF L AND M.

As 1 have said elsewhere, my record of the readings of L and M
depends mainly (where 1 dissent from previous editors) upon informa-
tion supplied to me by P. Thielscher‚ who has collated both MSS.
Occasionassy, however, a direct statement of other collators is contra-
dicted only by the silence of Thielscher. In such places Ι have not
ventured to draw any inference ex silentio. Ι give here, in the prin—
cipal passages, the reading to which Thielscher’s silence points.
That positively attested by other editors will be found in my Apparatus
Criticus.

These variants (twenty-seven in number) are all trivial ς and no one of
them (sare perhaps 195 and 550) is even interesting. 1 have therefore
not cumbered my Apparatus with the doubts they suggest—some of
these doubts it would need the eyesight of an Epidaurian serpent to
resolve. Where a direct statement of Thielscher deliberately contra-
dicts a direct statement of other collators I have throughout followed
Thielscher. I would ask the reader particularly to note that where
Ι am silent about certain variants of M recorded in other collatioris,
my silence means that these variants are, according to the positive
testimony of Thielscher‚ not found in Μ.

¹ But δωδεκάτροπος is used for ‘the Zodiac’ by Vettius Valens (supply
‘YP‘WW'N Astr. Cat. v. 2, p. 93, and 310, note 5.

* In the passages which l have marked with an asterisk Thielscher is,
1 think, probably wrong. For in these the readings reported by Ellis or
Loexve are found in the Holkham MS.-a MS. which is, 1 have now no doubt,
derived directly from M.
