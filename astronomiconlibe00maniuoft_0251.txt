COMMENTARY καφ-41

820. proximus: next in eminence or importance.

extrema: so 1 have altered est ima, not only because the trajec-
tion of est is very harsh, but because proximus extrema gives a true,
proximus ima at most a clumsy antithesis: ‘next to, though furthest
from: extrema means, of course, furthest from the μεσουράνημο, and
onl so ima.

8³32. ⁴ Its influence is less in outward show, but greater in practical
utility’—for the ordinary work of the world. The foundations are
never as fair in specie as the superstructure, but they alone are indis-
pensable.

After this line I have inserted 739—on which see note above.
‘Creater in its influence is that which is less (in outward show), for
the reason that, by the very region it occupies (partibus ipsis), it con-
trols the foundations of things and governs wealth.’

824—8. Obelized by Bentley and Pingre; but some amplification of
fundamenta . . . censusque in 823 seems necessary. ‘ 1t examines.
when mines have been dug, how far hopes have been ratified‚ and
how much you may win out of the hidden (undug) wealth of the
earth.

826. aequali pollens in parte: ‘machtig in der gleichen Stellung,
namlich als cardo: Breiter, Wrongly. Housman also, when he accepts
aeque illi pollens, has not understood the passage, and the elision is
un-Manilian; see note on 747. The Exortus is said to be aequali
pollens in parte because it is neither μεσουράνημα nor ἀντιμεσουράνημιι
(neither top nor bottom), but terras aequali limite cernit (792): not
merely because it is a cardo (Breiter), but just because it is Exortus.
The blunder atque illi for aequali occurs also at 233.

828. discribit, ‘apportions'z the subj. is dies. The MSS. offer
describet; the correction is due to Bechert‚ though describit is already
given in all the early editions.

829. hinc: sc. quia tempus in horas discribit.

831. hunc penes arbitrium uitae est: this correction (Housman)
is, 1 think, rnore satisfactory than any other. hic tenet . . . uitae. llic
involves a hiatus not credible in Manilius (yet so Pingre‚ Jacob);
uitae atque hic (edd. uett.) is more than crude, and so is Bentley's uz‘taz
lzic. Breiter’s nunc . . . nunc, giving as it does a false sense, is merely
slipshod.

832. fortunam: i. q. successum; not the element of chance—for
ducet per artes—but ‘ happy issue '.

833. qualiaque excipiant: subaud. dabit.

834. cultus, ‘education ’ς sede, ‘ station of life.'

835. utcumque : prout bene uel male subscribent, Bentley, rightly;
comparing iii. 119 utcumque regunt dominantia sidera, paret ; iii.
128 si male subscribent stellae per signa locatae. But Pingre mis-

translzgtes, though Du Fay, whose inaccuracy he censures, is right
enoug .

astra: planetae.

839. coniugia: the O. C. C. is called γαμοστόλος τόπος in Paulus
Alexandrinus (Scaliger), Brit. Mus. Pap. CX„ Anon. p. 139 (Bouche—
Leclercq, p. 273 n.). Breiter cites Firmicus ii. 8 ex hoc loco qualitatem
et quantitatem (a touch of humour, here l) quaeramus nuptiarum.

extremaque tempora uitae: cf. Lucan vii. 380-1 ultima fata
deprecor et turpis extremi cardinis annos.

840. coetus: coitus, Bonincontrius.

841-5 5. It is not enough to observe the κέντρα, cardines ; the μεσό-
