11 555-71 COMMENTARY

by Manilius. At 333 quadrati caeli? At 646 quadratis signis? At
iv. 331 quadrato sibi?—though, in these three places, it seems more
natural to take quadratum as a subst. ComparingiV. 331 Taurumque
quadrato coniunctum sibz, we might perhaps here take the words as
‘each of which signs (quod signum utrumque) is squared with
Libra.'

557. in totidem fecundus· as iv. 124 secundis z‘n uellera lam's;
iv, 161 zn totsecundi conztlzenta3 cf. iv. 826 ste mles ad semina terrae.

562. natura et lege: the general law laid down at 528 sqq. —the
natuial opposition ofsenna and lzumana.Sca1iger‘s naturae lege
seems unnecessmy, though the expression is found at i. 669, v. 375.

562 ²¹. quin etiam Tauri quae stellis signa minantur. That
some such line as I have here conjecturally appended has dropped
out of our MSS. may, I think, be regarded as almost certain ε

(1) haec eadem in 563 refers to nothing at all. Editors refer it
to Geminis nati, &c., in 561. This gives us a construction of this
sort: llos depressisse uolunt Geminis uati .· eadem, Capricorne, tibi
inimica suut. It would puzzle Capricorn by the aid of that sentence
to find his enemies.

(2) Gemini, Libra, Aquarius are the enemies already os three
signs (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius), conjunctly and individually. They have
enough to do without molesting Capricorn. Moreover‚ they are
a triangle which should naturally be friendly to Capricorn. There is
no example in Manilius' list of any sign attacked by all three members
of a non—alternate triangle. Capricorn’s natural enemies are those of
the other members of her triangle‚ those, firstly‚ which Taurus and
Virgo have in common, viz, Cancer, Scorpion, Pisces, and further
Libra, the enemy of the ferine Taurus but not of Virgo.

(3) The pagination of the archetype supports the conjecture of
a lost line. See Introduction, p. xxiii- iv.

566. turba sub unius iuuenis uirtute ferarum· . ‘a mere rout of
wild beasts when one youth's valour manifests itself.' So we must
render the text if it be retained [iuuenis is, of course, Aquarius;
the view, which has been held by some editors, that it is Sagittarius
deserves mention only forits foolishness]. turba apparently=exercitus
turbatu53 sub ‘on the occasion of', as osten in Manilius.

Housman writes fugiens for iuuenis3 but iuuenis is needed to
emphasize the human character of the victor. For the form of the
line compare iv. 34 tresque sub unius fratres uirtute iacerent.

568. One desiderates the mention of Libra among the enemies of
Pisces; since all the ferine signs save Pisces are attacked by both
Libra and Virgo. Manilius may very well here have forgotten Libra.
Or we could make room for him between 568 and 569; or we could
boldly write el Gemini fratres et Chelae et Virginis astrum.

570-8. Besides the hostilities already enumerated, we must be pre-
pared to find that signs separated from each other by a single sign are
for the most part mutually inimical. [Manilius gives a geometrical
reason for this3 but there is no doubt a mythological one at work
also. viz. that tertia are for the most part opposed as lzumara to
ferina3 all the masculine tertm are so opposed, and half the feminine. ]

570. nec sola est ratio: i. e neque est r'atzo trigonorum alter-
nautium sola ratze quae dat, διε. Cf. 722 nec 0 mss est unum r'atzo
nec β) odzta simplex.

571. bella: so Housman, with certainty. Breiter retains uelle.
But (1) mutua uelle in itself means nothing, it cannot stand for mutue
