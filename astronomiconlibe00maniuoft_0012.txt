PREFACE

the MSS, together with such emendations as I have placed
in the text. Only so could Ι achieve clearness‚ for there
is hardly a line in Manilius which has not been harassed by
conjecture. Yet this method was bound to do injustice to
the many scholars who have exercised brilliant talents
upon the emendation of the Astronomz‘ca. Accordingly
I have added an AppendiX, consisting of two partS. In
the first part will be found select lections from the editions
prior to Scaliger ¹, and in the second the principal con-
jectures from Scaliger onwards. The first part has eost
me much labour, and has brought me little reward. Yet
I have, I think, exhibited the interrelation of the edd. vett.
as it has not been exhibited before3 and Ι have restored
a good many emendations to their first authors—a service
for which I shall perhaps not be thanked by scholars who,
looking for their conjectuies in Part II, find them in Part I
against the symbol E (= αἰτίαν es omnes ante Scalzgerum).
1 have not attempted a complete collation of the edd. vett.
But Ι have cited those readings which seemed to me to
possess interest, making it a rule, wherever I cited a given
reading, to cite all the editions at that point. For lines
1-500 I have quoted all the editions wherever Jacob cites
Molinius²= for the rest I have made my own selection.
The chief value of my citations consists, I fancy, in their
revelation of the greatness of Scaliger. Scaliger had before
him, when he produced his first edition, merely some one
or other of these miserable editiones ueteres. It needs
some familiarity with the older texts before one realizes
with what justice he speaks of Manilius (to Henri ΙΙΙ)
as of an author—

Quem recenter a nigris
leti tenebris imminentis, a dirae
obliuionis uindicauimus sato,

¹ All save the solio sine loco et anno (of which there is no copy in
England, and, so far as 1 know, only one in Europe ; the second Neapolitan
(a mere reprint ofthe first) 3 and the second edition osPrfickner(substantia11y
the same as the first).

2 For the readings of Molinius Ῑ depend upon Jacob, occasionally verifying
him where 1 had a doubt, and once or twice correcting him.
