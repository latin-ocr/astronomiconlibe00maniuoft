COMMENTARY 902—15

are said to fight with the secret instruments of disease is noteworthy
and even suspicious3 but cf. on 4-5.

903. quad ambzgro casusne deine uiribus geminis accidat, Breiter, but
he does not explain what the geminae uires are ; I suppose the power
of health and the force of disease. casusne deine seems assured
from Aen. xii. 321 incertum, quis tantam Rutulis laudem, casusne
deusne (casusne deusne M), attulerit ; in which passage incertum exactly
corresponds in construction to our amszgunm—though Ellis desiderates
some word quo referatur ambiguum. Cf. Germ. Arat. 315-16 est etiam,
incertum qao cornu missa, sagitta.

905—10. The ninth regio = regio Phoebi.

965. medium post astra diem = astra post medium diem (so
already Bonincontrius). Explained more fully by what follows, ‘the
regio (--- astra) that comes after the medium caeli and the heights
where they first begin to slope down from the summit of the poised
universe.’ The ninth regio is post medinm diem as the eleventh (881) is
ante medium diem. For the anastrophe medinm p. astra diem see
note on 53. For astrum = regia cf. 8823 but the plural presents
difficulty. Breiter follows Scaliger in emending to castra; but even
so he propounds an impossible interpretation. castra he takes as
= cardinem (!) and thinks that the ninth regia can be called medius
dies post cardinem, the midday or zenith that follows the midday or
zenith. To witness if1 lie let any one consult his note. Not content
with this, in order to show that astra is impossible, he says that
astrum would be possible because at 882 it stands for cara'o, but at
882, though it does stand for a carde, yet Breiter’s own note on 882
lays it down that it stands for the regio ante cardinem! In 964 (by
which Breiter supports castra) castris is clearly metaphorical.

medii post (c)astra die, Scaliger, awkwardly3 medium post
articulum, Bentley, audaciously ; medium post dextra diem, Ellis, i. e.
dextra loca post mediam diem. But Manilius nowhere here employs
the distinction of laeua and dexlra signa ; and indeed is speaking of
regiones, and Ι am not sure whether these could appropriately be called
laeuae and dextrae.

907. sub quo quia is due to Ellis; so too Housmam in sub quo
(lzoc Jacob !) quoque, Bentley, διο, quoque is meaningless.

908. detergent: decernunt codd„ which Ellis (q. ν.) defends.
Phoebus might be said decernere uitia for the regio (as in Ellis’
examples from Firmicus, διο), but not conversely. Moreover decernunt
αἰτία would demand aut for et. Jacob, followed by Housman, reads
declinant. My detmgent is palaeographically nearer and more suited
to the associations of the god of purification. For this use of detergere
compare Claudian Eutrop. ii. 10—11 ire recentes detersum maculas;
and, for the purificatory power of the sun in disease, Gratius Cyn. 421-2
(of diseased cattle) nudis incumbant uallibus aestu, Ι Α uento,
clarique faces ad solis nt omne Ι Exsudent uitium.

Jacob’s declinant is, Ι suppose, based on Cicero De Offic. i. 6. 19
declznant uitia. The C. G. L. ν. 451 has ditergit abstergit uel
declz'nauz't.

910-17. The third regio (Phoebe), diametrically opposed to the ninth
(Phoebus) ; called Dea, as the ninth Deus.

910511. The third regia is the first as one passes up from 1. M. C.
to O. . C.

915. fataque, &C.‚ ‘expressing missortune by the ruinous edges of her
sace,' Ellis. But Du Fay, Jacob, Breiter take the line quite differently.
