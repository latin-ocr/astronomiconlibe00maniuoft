COMMENTARY 643-9

antithesis is between a star which is sufficient to itself and loses
nothing of itself and a star which lends parts of itself and receives
parlts of other stars; solis, that is, = not singulis (as Du Fay) but
m zuzszs.

644. This line is proscribed by Bentley, Jacob, Breiter, &c.; and
such a consensus of rejection is impressive. ‘VVeder templa caeli
noch Planeten gehoren hierher,’ says Breiter, dogmatically. But
whatever may be said of templa caeli (and locum caeli is not = templa
caeli, but is far more general) I venture to think that the planets do
very essentially ‘hierher gehoren ’. In the preceding two notes I have
tried to shOW, and in the notes that follow Ι shall try to make it clearer,
that editors generally have not understood the connexion of ideas
in 643—749 as a wh01e3 and that Breiter has misunderstood it more
grievously than any one else. 643* 5 introduce the dodecatemories (see
next note); and with the dodecatemories the planets are very inti-
mately connected, although Manilius does not introduce the subject of
their influence till 738 sqq. and treats it there only in summary fashion,
promising to return to the same theme later (75o)-a promise, like
many others, never fulfilled.

645. Scaliger, Du Fay, Stoeber, Pingre, Breiter have all, Ι think,
misunderstood this line, and as a consequence the whole of what
follows. parte is not = situ ; but means quodpartes suas alz'z's agnis
dant alienasque partes uicissim capiunt ; lit. ‘in respect of a part ’.

uires linea mutat does not mean that the signs are different in
their uires according as they are triangular, quadrangular, ἃς. (so
Scaliger, Breiter, &c.), but it means that the linea (whether triangular,
quadrangular, or what not) changes its powers—that is to say, the
triangles, quadrangles, &c., themselves change their powers—parte,
owing to distribution, owing, as we shall presently see, to the dode—
catemories; cs. 856 sqq.

649-50. 1 have transposed these two lines so as to make them
follow 645. In their present place they are——unemended—nonsensical.
In 646—8 we are told that quadrangles, triangles, tertia szgna, contraria
all have their uires ; then 649-50 ‘hence the mundus now gives to, now
takes away from thern, their strength, &c.' What? as a consequence
of their being triangles, &c., hence, on this account, do they lose their
strength at one moment and get it at another? Nothing more untrue.
They get and lose their strength owing, not to their being triangles, &c.,
but to the dodecatemories, to the fact that parte genus uariant.

649-50 were the last lines of the verso of fol. 36 of our archetype ;
see Introduction, pp. xxiii-iv. This circumstance lends strength to
my conjecture that they ought to follow 645. If accidentally omitted
after 645 (and uires being fifth word in each line might assist the
omission), they would naturally be inserted as the last lines of a page.
The spurious 651 stood in the lower margin of the same page. Now if
the reader will turn to the table in the Introduction, p. xxiV, he will find
(1) that 671—2 were also the last Iines of a page (followed also by
a spurious line 683 in the lower margin) ; (2) that this page wassol. 37
recto, i.e. the page which faced 36 verso, Before I was myself aware
of this Ι had transposed 671—2 to follow 667 (as they stand in my text).
If the first of these transpositions is correct, it confirms the other in
a very striking manner. 649-50 on the verso stood in one line with
671-23 and if we suppose that the scribe of A copied not first the
whole verso then the whole recto, but wrote continuously (i. e. the first
line os the verse, then the first of the recto, then the second of the
