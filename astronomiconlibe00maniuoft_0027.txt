THE THREE PRINCIPAL MSS.

of A.¹ For from 343—408 gives us 66 lines (three pages), and
409 is a versus z’rrepticius. Omitting 409 as interpolated, our next
page will be 410—31 3 and 432 is also spurious. From this point
our clues are fewer and more difficult to seize. 43 2-562 gives us
six pages less one line 5² and I hope to show conclusively in my
Commentary that a line has been lost after 562. The next page
in A will be 563—84‚ and probably bolla 585 and 586 should be
rejected (586 has long been a suspected line). From 5850650
is a distance of three pages less one line‚³ but 651 is the most
obvious and universally recognized interpolation ,· so that, despite
the deficiency of a line, I suspect that 650 ended a page. And
this suspicion seems confirmed by the following considerations.
(1) 652-72 give us with 6593. (see Commentary) a page, and
after 672 we have the beginning of a series of small transposi-
tions, for the detail of which see Cominentary ; (2) from 6 52—7 38
we traverse a space of four pages, and in my Commentary Ι shall
try t0'show how the removal of 739 at once gives sense to the
two lines which} it separates3 (3) from 740—914 yields‚ with 739,
eight pageS‚ and 915 is spurious ; (4) 936 is an interpolation, and

’ 915—36 = one page.

This arithmetical spacing of faults in our text can scarcely be
accidental. It means that we are on the track of A. Our guides
are not so certain as they were in Book Ι. But even so it seems
possible to conjecture the pagination and lineation of A with a fair
degree of probability, and with fruitful results to the criticism of
our text. If 110, 208, 231, 342 were each the last line of
a page, then the first page of Book ΙΙ must have contained only
1—9. Now we saw that in A fol. 22 v contained Ι. 923—6. There
no doubt followed a subscriptio (one line) and the capitula (which
appear in both L and M). We cannot say how many lines-these
fourteen capitula occupied in A, but if we allow for* these seven
lines, then fol. 22 v will consist of the required number of 22
lines (Ι. 92 3-6‚ subscriptio, seven lines of capitula, ΙΙ. 1-9).

¹ The following considerations may suggest the explanation of this: the
last words of 318, 319, 320 respectively are trigona, trigonam, quadrata3
the last words of 342 and 344 respectively are tmjgom's, quadrata. The
scribe's eye when he got to tmjgom's in 342 <end os 29 v) wandered to the
end of 29 r. See table following as well as my note at 649-50.

² 1 include 432 in this calculation7 imagining it to have usui-ped the place
os a genuine line.

⁸ 631 is not in the MSS.
