COMMENTARY 244—53

246. Aries: classed among cum-enlm, despite the p1ctor1al repre-
sentations of him, since longe maxima currens orbe suo spatia, Germ.
224. (Bouche-Leclercq‚ p. 152 n.)

in cornua tortus: ipsa quidem cornua torta sunt: at totus
Aries nec tortus est nec esse dicitur, Bentley, who writes toruus (found
already in Vera), comparing Sil. Ital. XV. 62—3 uerti . . . nunc auis in
formam nunc torui in cornua tauri, where he says, perhaps truly‚ that
the construction is lauri torm· z'n cornua (cf. the Vergilian irasci in
cornua). Yet tortus may very well be sound; it is more than the
horns of Aries that is tortus, as appears from iv. 506 et ceruice prior
flexa quam cornibus exit. See e. g. the pretty illustration in Du F ay,
p. 33, or Bouche-Leclercq‚ p. 131. [At Verg. Aen. vi. 571 the MSS.
vary between tortosque and toruosque]

For in cornua compare, perhaps, besides irasci in cornua (Verg.
Georg.iii.232; Aen. xii. 104), from Manilius the strange expression i-341
stellatus z'n alas3 and again i. 355 in poenas szgnata suas; iv. 509 in
cornua fertur is not in point, nor at iii. 631 pacatas languet in undas.

251. Libra. Clearly Libra is here represented as a person, holding
a Balance (as Firmicus viii. 3). But what person? Palamedes (with
whom Libra is elsewhere sometimes identified) is hardly in point here.
The words emerito . . . orbe laborum suggest the true answer. The
labores can scarcely be, as Breiter says, the labor librandi3 for how
could the labor lz'brandz' be a round of labours, orbis laborum? sub
emerito . . . orbe laborum can only mean ‘on the occasion of (as
187, q. ν.) the completion of his round of labours ’. [The orbis laborum
is said to be ‘ paid off’, ‘ discharged ’-—by a not unnatural transference ;
strictly it is Libra that is ‘ paid off’.] Now the only person who can
possibly be conceived as having thus completed a round of duties is
the Sun; and in the Augustan and post-Augustan poets emeritus is
frequently so used os the Stin, in respect of the completion whether os
his diurnal or of his annual orbz's; e. g. Ovid Fasl. iii. 43 quominus
emeritis exiret cursibus annus 3 sb. iv. 688 emeritis . . . Phoebus equis3
Stat. T lzeb. i. 336 (Titanis) peremeriti surgens confinia l’lzoebz'; Seneca
Ag. 908 emerito die ; T lcyest. 797 emeritos cursus; Epigr. iv. P.L.M.
IV. p. 56 emeritam . . . facem. The Sun, then, when he comes to
Libra, is said to have finished off his ‘ round of toils ³. He has entered
the winter signs; he has passed into the night (220 sex a Clzelz's nocturna
uideri); from the point of view of his annual course he has set, and
is thus as appropriately called emeritus as at his daily Setting.

orbe laborum perhaps contains a suggestion of the identification
os Heracles with the Sun found in Nonnus xl. 367·410; see Bouche-
Leclercq, p. 577. 1.

252. Since sitting is the most natural attitude for shivering.

contractus, ‘ huddled up ' ; Hor. Ep. i. 7. 11 contractusque legem
Phaedrus. iv. (24) 25. 20 mori contractam Ῐνζξονε ; Verg. Georg. iv, 259
contractofivgrore ngrae is perhaps different.

253. quaeue, contra MSS. Ι have received Breiter's conjecture,
based on the lemmata to 247-9. But there is a good deal to be said,
palaeographically, for Bentley’s strata. Strata before iacent became
stra, and this was read as ἱίνιι = contra. It seems to rne simplem
however, to suppose contra to be a mere dittography of contra(ctus) in
252. Stoeber defends the MSS. ‘Who,’ he asks plaintively‚ ‘could
be so illiberalis as to resuse a false quantity to a poet who everywhere
