11 150-3 COMMENTARY

peculiar to one accidentally surviving authority matter which may very
well have been common to many writers.

From 150—269, it should be noted, the signs are considered indi-
gidually3 in what follows, 270 sqq„ they are treated os in their com-

inations.

150. Cf. Verg. Georg. ii. 9 Principio arboribus uaria est natura
creandis. et primum: Manilius, as Breiter points out, here first passes
from astronomy to astrology.

If it be asked why Manilius assigns a prior importance to the dis-
tinction of sex rather than, as might seem more natural, to the distinc-
tion of human or bestial, the cause lies in the planets. The distinction
between human and bestial signs is extremely powerful in detennining
love and hate among the signs themselves; but the sex of the signs
determines the loves and hates both of the signs and of the planets‚
Manilius never gets to the planets‚ but he cannot but write always
with his eye upon them.

151. genus, ‘sex,’ as appears from the next words. The deter-
mining principle of sex among the signs is purely mathematical. The
uneven number is always, according to the Pythagoreans, masculine,
the even feminine. And this doctrine, transmitted to astrology by the
Platonizing Stoics of the Middle Stoa, determines the sex of the signs.
The first sign, Aries, is masculine; the second, Taurus, feminine3
and the same alternation prevails throughout the circle.

152. principe Tauro: Taurus is princeps fimininorum, as Aries is
princeps omnium signorum (i. 263, Germ. 502). Of old, indeed,
Taurus was princeps absolutely. Verg. Georg. i. 217 candidus auratis
aperit cum cornibus annum Taurus; Schol. Germ. Breysig p. 16
Nigidius Arietem dicit ducem et principem signorum.

Various mythological explanations have been essayed of the sex of
Taurus. Breiter holds that Manilius identifies Taurus with 103 see
Hyg. ii. 21 ; Eratosth. 106-7. But since Manilius elsewhere (as Germ.
5363 Hyg. ii. 21) plainly identifies Taurus with Europa’s Bull (see ii.
489-90), Breiter is obliged to suppose that he here follows a ‘ special
source .

Taurus is by other authorities identified with Pasiphae’s Bull, and
again with Apis. Bouche-Leclercq supposes that al] these different
views amount in themselves to very little; while what emerges is that
Taurus is originally the vehicle of a moon-deity and love-deity
(Astarte-Aphrodite). The Pleiades—the doves of Venus-connect
naturally with a love—deity.

153. auersus: a necessary correction of aduersus; the same con-
fusion, in the same connexion, is found at Verg. Georg. i. 218 (where
auerso . .. astro refers to Taurus and not, as Conington, &c.‚ to Canis),
Ovid Met. ii. 80; Man. i. 264, v. 140.

Taum· is est situs ut posterioribus carens ab eis tamen exsurgat,
Du Fay. Scaliger quotes Ovid Fast. iv. 717—18 uacca sit an Taurus
nonest cognoscere promptum; pars prior apparet, posteriora latent.
The epithet auersus, and its suggestions, attached, for astrologers, the
imputation of vice to those born under Taurus: cf. in this connexion
iv. 521, ν. 194. See Salmasius Anni Climacterici (1648), Praes.

pects the text. Du Fay takes arcum as = circulum (szgnzjserumk-
