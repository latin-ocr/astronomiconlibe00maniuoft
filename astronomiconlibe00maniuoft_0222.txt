502. infra: below Libra, i. e. immediately preceding Libra (below
Aries, says ssecliert).

503. oditque: 50 Bentley sor auditque, with certainty; cf. n. on 496.

505 sinum: Verg. Ecl. vii. 33 ubiv Serv.

509. in Augusti felix cum fulserit ortum. Much has been written
upon this passage, and to little purpose. The latest commentator,
Breiter, does not improve upon his predecessors. Breiter refers his
readers to his note upon iv. 548. Turning to iv. 548 I read: ‘ Augustus
was born on ix. cal. Octobr., therefore (also) on Sept. 23 under the
sign of Libra, as he himself testifies in the letter written to Gaius on
ix. cal. Octobr. a. u. 763—in Gellius xv. 7. 9. Manilius in ii. 508 seems
to contradict this: quid enim mirabitur ille maius, in Augusti felix
cnm fulserit ortum, that is, Capricorn, which begins on Dec. 23 . .
We must, however, assume that ortum refers not to birth but con-
ception.’ I pass by here the fact that Capricorn usually ¹ ‘ begins ' on
Dec. 22, not on Dec. 23, and that he ‘began', when Manilius wrote, some
days earlier than this; for the Romans at this time threw back the
beginnings of each sign by about seven degrees. 1 pass by the fact
that Augustus’ letter to Gaius testifies only to ix. cal. Octobr. 1 pass
by the fact that ix. cal. Octobr. is not Sept. 23 but Sept. 22, for
September in 63 B. C. had only 29 days. These are errors incidental
to human frailty; and, after all, nothing in the world is much harder
than simple arithmetic. But the statement that because Augustus
was born on Sept. 22 he was therefore born under Libra Ι can hardly
allow to pass unchallenged. As far as the mere date Sept. 22 15
concerned he might equally well have been born under Aries. Similarly
the fact—or fiction—that Capricorn ‘begins’ on Dec. 23 has nothing
in the world to do with whether Augustus was, or was not, born under
that sign. These statements must be challenged because, though they
are in, they are not of Breiter, but are the common stock of recent
writers upon the subject. These writers, notable among whom are
Freier, W. V. Voigt, and-more recently— Bickel, hold the opinion,
apparently countenanced by, and perhaps borrowed froin, Bouche'-
Leclercq (pp. 384 sqq. ), that the sign ‘under' which a man is ‘ born'
is that 1n which the sun stands at his birth. It is well then here to
state plainly that the sign under which a man is born is, for the
ancient astrologers, the sign that is ‘horoscopating’ ‚ rising on the
horizon, at the moment of his birth. See Housman, Praef. lxx—lxxi
(characteristic). Have we any means of knowing what sign was
horoscopating at the moment of Augustus’ birth?

Suetonius tells us (Aug. 5) that Augustus was born ix. kal. Oct.
paulo ante solis exorsum. Now the sun at the present time enters
Libra on Sept. 233 that is to say, on Sept. 23 he rises simultaneously
with the first degree of Libra. If, therefore, Augustus was born on
Sept. 22 about smerise, he was born under Libra, since according to
Roman reckoning with sunrise Libra was ‘horoscopating’. But it is
the specification ‘about sunrise' which makes all the difference.

¹ The sun has entered Capricorn on Dec. 23 only once (by Greenwich time)
since the institution of the Gregorian Calendar: it will not do 50 again till
