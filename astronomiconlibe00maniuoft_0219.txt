COMMENTARY 466

like latitude see, signs of like longitude hear, one another. This
parallelism leaves Cancer and Capricorn (among the βλέποντα) and
(among the ἀκούοντα) Aries and Libra, ἅζυγ γα, unrelated. They are
said to see—or hear—themselves. (b) The equinoctial signs love the
sign preceding them (Aries- Taurus, Libra· -Scorpion); and relations of
love or hate connect the pairs situated on lines parallel to those uniting
these equinoctial pairs (viz. Pisces-Gemini, Aquarius-Cancer, Capri-
corn-Leo, Sagittarius—Virgo); see Fig.

The system here followed by Manilius was already before his date
discredited among scientific astrologers. It is severely criticized by

Geminus (lsagoge‚ ch. 2). Its πρῶτον ψεῦδος consists in the fact that it
assumes that the cardinal points in the tropic signs are in the middle
of those signs. This heresy Scaliger supposes to have originated with
Eudoxus, Subsequent astronomers (among them Geminus) transferred
the cardinal points to a σημεῖον λόγῳ θεωρητόν (Geminus ii. 33) between
the signs. This rearrangernent involved a completely different system
of ξύζυγα. The new system may be seen in the ‘ Antiscia ' of Firmicus
ii. 27 sqq., in substance the same system as that of Ptolemy (Firm. ii.
29). Firmicus professes (ii. Praef.) to follow Dorotheus of Sidon.
