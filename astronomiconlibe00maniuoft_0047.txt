been earlier than the tenth century. And we have no hint of any
other MS. of Manilius of such an antiquity. Traube1 finds the
provenance of G and L in Lorraine. W hence Leoni's MS. came
to him is beyond conjecture. It is noticeable that he was a doctor
of medicine, since in so many of our MSS. (UR [ΠΗ Caes.)
Manilius is bound up with medical treatises.

That Politian's MS. cannot be identified with A—the Poggian
original—will be obvious to any one who has read what 1 have
said about A on pp. xxv sqq„ and who will further trouble to read
the Section upon the Madrid MSS„ sz and X 81.

2. Codex Pl'tlzeeamts. All that has hitherto been known—or
at any rate related—of this MS. is just so much as is to be found
in the Praefatio ² to Bentley's edition z ‘ Usus est praeterea codice
P. Pithoei, cuius uarias lectiones in margine editionis primae
Bononiensis uidit: hic quasi medius est inter uetustos illos
(GL Venetus) et recentiores et in plurimis convenit cum Vos-
siano.' I think I am in a position to add something to our
knowledge of this lost codex, and to convict the Praefatio os
Bentley's edition, i. e. Bentley's nephew, of error. Two letters

„of Bentley (xvii and xviii, ed. 1842, pp. 36—7) deal with this MS..
Bentley writes to the Rev. Dr. E. Bernard, living in Holywell,
Oxford, thus: ‘Among Sir Edward’s <i.e. Sherburne’s) papers
I find the collationes ex Mto Cod. Pithoei upon the first book:
this, he tells me, he borrowed of you, being Scaliger’s edition with
those variations in the margin. . . . I find by what Sir Edward
hath transcribed that it was no very old book, being of the last
rate of books, equal to the Codex Palatinus, that of C. C. C. and
your own 3 in 40, and those from whence the first editions were
printed3 llze second ναῖε is an Italian MS. wlzose variations are
written by Is. Vossius in tlze Bononiam edition: tlzis J call a young
Gemblacensis . . . it confirms tlze Gemb. iu lumzdreds (gf places for
whiclz before we lead [aut oue witness' (p. 36). It is, surely, clear
that the Codex Pithoei is a MS. quite distinct from the MS.
referred to in the portion of this letter which Ι have italicized.
Codex Pithoei and the ‘young Gemblacensis' are two quite
different MSS. But Bentley's nephew, misunderstanding this
letter, has supposed them to be one and the same. The ‘young
Gemblacensis' is the MS of which I shall speak presently as
