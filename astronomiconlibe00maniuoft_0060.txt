INTRODUCTION II

     

C Sacc. xii

Μοιιιθ

The pure Italian group stands out clearly—AI and its five
derivatives,¹ URH V ² μ. Between M and URH there lies at least
one now lost copy (m) 3 for so only—since they are independent
os one another—can we explain the fact that they all conjoin
Manilius and Serenus. R seems from its readings, so far as these
are known, further removed from M than either U or H. Between
M, again, and V ² there lies at least one now lost codex (x) 3 for,
as Ι have pointed out elsewhere,¹ V ² was copied frorn a MS. con-
taining 26 lines to each page. These facts have importance only
for lines 1-82 of Book I.

The pure Belgian family consists of GL Ven. <all saec. xi), C
(saec. xii), and the five fifteenth-century MSS„ V¹‚ v, c, V ³, Pz‘tlz„

¹ For the relation of these MSS. to M see C. 9., i. 4, p. 297, iii. 1,
pp. 57-9; Brester, Praefatio, pp. vi—vii. The relation os μ to URH
must remain uncertain till that rather inaccessible MS. has been examined.
