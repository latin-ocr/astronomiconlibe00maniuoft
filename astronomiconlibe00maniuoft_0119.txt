ASTRONOMICON II

They have no strange sense of aught alien mixed with them,
nor do they feel any grievous loss of aught of themselves 3
as certain signs do that have had part of them cut away
and possess limbs joined to them from bodies of other
sort; such as are Capricorn and he that conjoined with
the horse stretches his bow and takes aim. That latter,
indeed, hath one part man, but Capricorn none. This dis-
tinction, too, we must hold fast in our lofty science. It
makes a difference whether two stars are twin or of com-
pounded shape.

Note further that Erigone is reckoned among the double
signs3 she is not double by her form but according to
reason. For with the middle of Virgo on this side summer
ceases, on that autumn begins. All the tropical signs—the
Ram, the Claws, the Crab, Capricorn—are preceded by
double signs for the reason that the double signs unite in
themselves two seasons and so possess double powerS.
Thus, the Crab follows the twin brothers through the path
of the stars: and of the Twins the one gives us still the
flowery springtime‚ the other brings up the thirsty summer.
Yet both are naked, for both feel heat, the one the heat of
the failing spring, the other that of oncoming summer. The
’ last degree of the one is as the first degree of the other. The
Archer‚ moveover‚ who in himself gives the promise of thy
coming, Capricorn, is double in shape as he moves through
heaven. Mild autumn elaims as his own so much of the
Centaur as is smooth and shapely and of human fashion 3
but with his hinder parm, fashioned beastlike, he meets the
cold of winter.. . . The two Fishes, whom Aries sends
ahead of him, inform us of two seasons: the one of them
closes winter, the other opens out spring. When the sun
reapproaching runs his swift course through these watery
signs, winter rains and vernal showers meet and mingle;
both moistures obtain at once in the floating F ishes.

Furthermore‚ three of the signs are allied in warsare with
the other nine, and a kind of civil strife possesses the sky.
The Bull, look you, rises with his hinder quarters, the Twins
rise with their feet, the Crab with his shell; while the
