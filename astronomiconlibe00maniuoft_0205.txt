COMMENTARY 334—49

of MSS. as = paribus latertbus3 but Ι can find no parallel to this use
in Manilius. Cf. 310 in tris perducti partes . . . trigoni (where partes,
as here partibus, sufficiently implies equal parts).

cum: perhaps tu; cf. Lucr. ii. 491 sz'sorte uoles . . . -494 si tu
forte uoles3 Hor. Od. i. 9. 16 nec dulces amores sperne, puer, neque tu
choreas.

335. hie: in the case of the triangle; illic (336) in the case of the
s uare.

q poscit quint. part. c. s.‚ ‘the number 100 demands in addition
its fifth part,’ i.e. 203 the line of the triangle must cover 120 degrees.

336. With the square ‘ 100 loses its tenth part ’‚ result 90.

337. quiscumque: sub. locis (loca 338), hardly signis, for we are
now dealing with schematism μοιρικῶς.

iunctus, Regiomontanus rightly (for MSS. cunctis), supported, as
against Scaliger's iunctis (which, however, Breiter prefers), by 275
inque uicem extremis iungit se finibus ipsa.

The whole line is merely a periphrasis for the degrees in quad-
rangular (as the succeeding line for the degrees in triangular) schema-
tism.

339. See on 273. The line that forms the triangle is the line of the
circumference of the Zodiacal Circle, which (circulus ut clauditur, 273)
in tris aequalis discurrit ductus. When it thus discurrit, it is said to
leave by a straight path (recta-—ie by the path of the triangle) the
spreading and devious (circular) path (dispendia uiae) of the circum-
ference. The curve is a dispendium uiae ; as against a recta uia it is
a waste, a long route. For dispendia thus used of a curve, or circular
bend, see Rutil. Nam. 321-2 uix cz'rcumuelzimur sparsae dispendia
” rupis, nec sinuosa graui terra (cura MSS.) labore caret.

signata, Ι suppose, means ‘which it has traversed’ or trodden.
Pingre's rendering suggests that he took it as signis ornata (cf. i. 355
in poenas signata suas). signarit in 338 perhaps makes szjgrnata
somewhat suspicious. Possibly sinuata (suggested to me by sinuosa
in the lines just quoted from Rutilius).

Scaliger calls the line elegantissime dictmn. M‘z'rum uero, says
Bentley, si z'd elegantissimum quod omnino sensu cassum est. But
neither editor has understood the passage.

342-6. ‘And so not every triangular nativity has sympathy with the
signs of its triangle; nor do signs which happen to be quadrangular
necessarily on that account (continuo) preserve community of interests ’
—summing up everything from 297 ff.

Between 342 and 345 our MSS. repeat 318-19 (343—4). Breiter's
explanation of this is that the parent MS. of our MSS. was a codex
containing 25 lines to the page. This, as Breiter must have known
from Jacob, is not true3 for the facts see Introduction, pp. xix sqq.
Bentley, strangely enough, was the first to see the futility of emending

347. consumat: cf. 318; the word does not necessarily convey (as
it happens to do there) any notion of wrong use. Postgate's con-
summet seems idle.

349. efficiat: efficiet MSS. ; efficiens Scaliger, ed. I, speciously; but
he has not, 1 think, understood the passage. Like most editors after
him (I am not sure about Du Fay, and I find Jacob’s efficiet, with
a full stop after ambit, unintelligible) he sees in 347—51 only two
alternatives. There are, I think, three. It makes a difference,
Manilius says, whether the line (1) has the right number of degrees
