MANILIUS AND HIS EDITORS

dependent upon M, which has ‘Boeni⁷; and if they are 50, then
Kraemer's suggestion is at once ruled out. It is possible that
M ’s ‘Boeni’ is a blunder for ‘Boeti'3 and that, in the original
of M, ‘Boeti’ had been added after ‘Manili' by some one who
wished to identify the author of the Astronomica with Anicius
Manlius Torquatus Severinus Boetius.¹

We know neither when Manilius was born nor when he died.
He has always a tender regard for the Constellation Gemini.
Those born under that sign

unum pectus habent fideique immobile uinclum,
magnus et in multos ueniet successus amicos (ΙΙ. 630-2),

and Manilius is always (cp. II. 581 sqq.) peculiarly impressed by
the beauty and rarity of human friendship. In III. 152-61 he
tells us that under Gemini are born poets and astrohgers, and as
he elsewhere tells us that he was the first astrologer in poetry, we
may without being over—fanciful infer that he was himself born
under that constellation.

That he wrote under Augustus is certain, and that he survived
Augustus at any rate by a little is, I think, nearly certain.
Ι. 898-903 refers to the disaster of the Saltus Teutoburgiensis
(A. D. 9), and with a certain detachment which suggests that that
event, while not distant, was not of yesterday 3 while the con-
cluding lines of Book I show that Augustus was yet living (he
died in A. D. 14). Nor is there any reason to suspect—with
Breiter—the genuineness of Ι. 384-6, which also makes it clear
that Augustus is living. I. 798-801 :

Venerisque ab origine proles
Iulia descendit caelo caelumque repleuit,

quod regit Augustus socio per signa Tonanti,
cernit et in coetu diuum magnumque Quirinum

have caused some perplexity. In face of the other references to

¹ Is it just possible that we have here some confusion with the Stoic
Boethus? Geminus at Isagoge, xvii, ᾗ 48, speaks os Βόηθος ὁ φιλόσοφος
ἐν τῷ τετάρτῳ βιβλίῳ τῆς Ἀράτου ἐξηγήσεως. Besides his commentary upon
Aratus (with which Manilius could have been concerned only in Book Ι)
Boethus wrote also, as we know from Diogenes Laertius, treatises περὶ
φύσεως and περὶ εἱμαρμένης. On either of these works Manilius might have
drawn in Books 11 and 111. With the remark, attributed to Boethus, that
Aratus was ῡύχ Ἠσιόδου ἀλλ’ Ὀμήρου ζηλωτής (cf. Achilles, Commentt. in Arat. ,
Maass, p. 83, 28—9), it is interesting to compare Manilius 11. 1—38. All
that is known about Boethus may be seen in Maass'Aratea, pp. 152 sqq.‚ and
Pauly-Wissowa’s Real-Enwclopddie, iii, pp. 602-3.
