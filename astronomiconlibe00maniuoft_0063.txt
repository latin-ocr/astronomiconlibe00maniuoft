MANILIUS AND HIS EDITORS

M. Manilius in the titulus to his MS.—at any rate he says
nothing which would discountenance such a supposition.

The ‘M. Manlii Boeni' of M has provoked a good deal of
speculation. The name ‘Boeni', in other MSS. of the Italian
family, occurs as ‘Boetii '‚ and again as ‘Poeni '. From the form
‘ Poeni ’ it has been conjectured that Manilius was a Carthaginian‚
and that this accounts for his bad Latin. The fact is that his
Latin is extremely good (Kraemerl justly remarks that no one
has ever attempted to show in detail the ‘Africitas' of Manilius'
style), and that ‘Poeni' is a bad emendation (as ‘Boeti' is
perhaps a good one) of ‘ Boeni '. A Carthaginian could not have
written, to take only one example, anything so signally Roman
in temper as the Exordium to Book 1V.2 Bechert,³ in a single
sentence, has truly appreciated this essentially Roman temper of
Manilius: ‘Quotienscunque enim poeta res Romanas tangit,
dictio eius animum hominis uere Romani spirat.' And Manilius'
temper is not merely Roman, but it is markedly anti-Carthaginian.
Lanson⁴ in this connexion has aptly directed attention to IV.
112 sqq. It is a ⁴ singularis ac nouus patriae amor ⁷, says Lanson,
which can find nothing worthy of note in its native country save
⁴ ‘belluarum omne genus ac monstrorum ³.

‘Boetii’ deserves a more civil consideration. The great
Gerbert (Sylvester ΙΙ), ,ειεῑῐοηοῐηετ and humanist‚ writes to the
monk Rainard sor copies of ‘M. Manlius de Astrologia'. ‘Age
ergo et te solo conscio tuis sumptibus fac ut mihi scribantur
M. Manlius de astrologia, Victorinus (Victorius codd.) de
Rhetorica, Demosthenes Ophthalmicum.'⁵ In a letter,‘³ again, to
Archbishop Adalberon‚ he speaks of ‘viii uolumina Boetii de
astrologia’ which he had discovered. It has been conjectured
that this Manlius and this Boetius of whom Gerbert speaks were
one and the same person, and this person it has been sough't to
identify with our Manilius. This identification scholars as prudent
