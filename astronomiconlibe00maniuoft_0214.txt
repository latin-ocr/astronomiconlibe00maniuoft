11 412—23 COMMENTARY

i. 71, ii. 41‚and Housman on i. 656. The usage is Augustan, e. g. Verg.
Ecl. ii. 40 praeterea duo nec tuta mihi ualle reperti, and among post-
Augustan poets is greatly affected by Lucan, e. g. i. 72 nec se Roma
ferens; iv. 17 nec . . . colle minori, ἃς.

413. mascula si paribus: I have given this line as restored by
Scaliger. paribus (maribus, Bentley) must be retained if exemplis be
sound, and may perhaps in any case be defended by disparibus, ‘of
different sex‚’ in 390. Bentley complains of si. . . si. Quid autem
lzic uolunt si . . . si? certe in contrariis . . . nunquam non respondent
mascula maribus, feminea feminis. But, while it is true that all con-
traria are of the same sex, it is not true that they all respondent generi.
Feminea feminis, uir magne, non semper respondent .· quippe, si in-
}sequffntes uersus legisses, inuenisses Cancrum Capricorno repugnantem

417 .
si . . . si, therefore, resumes interdum in 411, and means ‘ in
certain cases where the tie of sex asserts itself’3 in some cases, e. g.
Cancer and Capricorn, it does not.
419. hinc: a C apn'corno.
420. hinc: a Cancro,
nudusque in solibus orbis: sor in solibus (Bentley) the MSS.
offer in collibus, which Pingre renders by ‘ les coteaux arides et
desseches'—and this is perhaps just possible, ‘ the earth is bare in the
matter of its hill tops,’ which get the full glare of the sun. In support
of this 1 would adduce Gratius, Cyneg. 421 ut nudis incumbant ualli-
bus aestu. Jacob interprets orbis as = ‘tout le monde‚’ everybody ;--
everybody is in the hills with his coat off, looking after the vines and
what not; of which Ellis says truly that it is ‘ uix latina locutio', and
Breiter‚ probably less truly‚ that it is ‘ nicht ernst zu nehmen '.
Ellis reads nudaeque (or, coll. 772 nudisque) in collibus urbes.-
‘ sub Cancro deseruntur urbes, colles petuntnr'3 but this seems to me
more Statian than Manilian.

421. noctes enim hibernae sub bruma, lz. e. sub initio Capricorni,
aequales sunt diebus aestiuis sub solstitio, h. e. sub initio Cancri, Du Fay.

Breiter’s aequans ‘der Concinnit'at halber’ is to me unintelligible.
quia in 418 (there should be only a comma at aestas) governs aequat
in 421 ; 419-20 are parenthetic, explaining brumae dissidet aestas.

422. annus : annum of MSS. can hardly be anything but a blunder3
discordant illos, 635, has no MS. authority, and declinat diem (Ellis),
797, is no parallel.

423. ne: G has nec; but here, as well as at 577 (though there necis
attested by all MSS.) and 951 (ne all MSS), q. v., ne . . . is preferable.
Ι note here a passage of Catullus where, though a similar use of ne is
rgcognized, there is a faulty punctuation which should be corrected
t us :-

LXVIII. 135-40:

quae tamen etsi uno non est contenta Catullo
rara uerecundae furta feremus herae.

ne nimimn simus stultorum more molesti,
saepe etiam Iuno, maxima caelicolum,

coniugis in culpa flagrantem continet iram,
noscens omniuoli plurima furta Iouis.

All editors place a comma at herae in 136 and a full stop after
molesti in 137. Quo quid insulsius ? At Juv. xii. 93 sq. the true read-
