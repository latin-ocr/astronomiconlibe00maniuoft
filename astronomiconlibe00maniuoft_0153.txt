ASTRONOMICON II

os the twelve signs that shine in heaven ; to the end that
the constellations might be bound together by thus giving
and receiving, and that the different parts of the sky might
have likeness one to another and every star contain some-
what of all others; so should there be out of this com-
mingling a governing harmony in the body of the universe,
and so should each part of it from a common interest aid the
other. Thus it is that though men are born under the same
signs, they reflect different characteristics and have opposed
desires. Thus it is that often human constellations stray
into bestial offspring, and in one sign there is born first
a male and then a female being. The ofsspring of the signs
are mixed even as the signs themselves: and the reason is
that individua] signs vary according as the degrees of the
signs generally are distributed‚ and by receiving the dode-
catemories they transform their influences. Now will Itell
you how many degrees, and in what order constant, belong
to each sign. Thus you will know the degrees in all the
signs and not go astray. Each sign retains for itself its
first dodecatemory: the next dodecatemory is given to the
sign immediately following. The other signs receive their
due proportion of degrees in order. The last degrees of

’ a given sign pass to the sign most distant. Thus each

sign keeps two and a half degrees of itself in its own con-
stellation, and its full complement of degrees is made up by
the exhaustion of the thirty degrees in each of the other
SlgTShere is more than one kind of procedure, and the rule

Α given to us admits variation. Nature has committed her

paths to more methods than one, and draws them in various
directions ; and her desire is that men should seek her out
by all routes. Another rule that has been devised for the
dodecatemories is this z—Multiply by twelve the number of
the degree in which the moon stands at any birth3 for the
signs that shine in high heaven are twelve. Subtract from
the result, and give to the sign in which the moon shone,
the proper number of that sign’s degrees. . . . Subtract
and give thirty degrees to the sign following and the same
number to the rest in order. [When this number falls short
of thirty, take what remains of it and divide it by two and
a half, distributing the result among the signs that remain.]
