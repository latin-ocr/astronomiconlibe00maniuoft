COMMENTARY 196—203

196. utraque sors umoris : that is, et hiberni imbres et uerni rores
(195). lt perceptibly deepens the pain of life when one finds aman
like Stoeber setting up against Scaliger’s certain correction such a piece
of tomfoolery as ‘ ultra quod sursum oris, ἅνω τοῦ στόματος ’.

fluitantia signa: aequorea astra (194) = Pisces.

197-202. Signa auersa: i. e. signa quae a posterioribus partibus sus·-
gunt3 viz. Taurus, Gemini, Cancer.

201. auersa: so Bullialdus for MSS. aduersa; see on 153. Bentley
defends aduersa .· ‘ Taurus quidem auersus surgit .· sed ab idipsum sol
aduersum eum eta fronte incurrz't', which is true enough in itself, and
gives a reason for the sun’s delay. But so does auersa, and one more
to the point. The signs through which the sun passes in the aestiui
menses (Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo) are three of them
auersa, three of them recta 3 hence the sun in these months encounters
a caelum in which there is a quasi seditio (198), and hence he is ham-
pered in his march. The aestiua segma are a ‘wrangling lot ', some
auersa, some recta, and hence the sun's difficulties.

Breiter rightly accepts auersa in his note (though he prints
aduersa in his text) ; but he has not understood the passage, and does
not see that the point of auersa lies in the seditio of auersa and recta
szjgna. ‘ The clunes of Taurus, the feet of Gemini, the testa of Cancer
are turned westward, not eastward. Dadurch soll ihr Aufgang langer
dauern.' Breiter incidentally does Du Fay an injustice by misquoting
him. Du Fay retains aduersa and renders it, not by reluctantia (as
Breiter says, rightly pointing out the fatuity of this), but by reluctantia
ceteris aliis (ceteris aestiuis Β), which is perfectly good sense and
expresses Manilius' meaning—though aduersa cannot yield this.
(aestiua, Bonincontrius in his Commentary, but in his text aduersa.)

In passing through the summer signs the sun occupies 186 days
10 hours, as against 178 days 2 hours in the winter months. The
astronomical cause lies of course in the sun ; Manilius poetically puts
the blame on the signs. The phenomenon to which Manilius here
alludes was first noticed by Hipparchus, who, by the observation of it,
was led to the important discovery of the eccentricity of the sun's orbit.

202. tardis mensibus: Verg. Gemg. i. 32. Cf. tardusque uias
(Phoebi), of the summer months, Nemes. Cyn. 165.

203-23. Szgrza nocturna et diurna. nocturna are not those that rise
by night, diurna those that rise by day (for all the signs rise at one
time by day, at another by night). nocturna and diurna are deter-
mined by certain partes sacratae which nature has assigned to the
sagma—by a mystical law of number and position. The diurna are
alternate pairs of signs beginning from Taurus and Gemini (viz.
Taurus-Gemini, Libra-Virgo, Capricorn-Aquarius. The nocturna are
alternate pairs beginning with Cancer and Leo, i. e. the pairs lying
between the diurnal pairs (viz. Cancer-Leo, Scorpion-Sagittarius,
Pisces-Aries).

Some hold that the diurna are Aries and the five following signs,
the nocturna Libra and the five following signs. Others identify
diurna with mascula, nocturna with feminea.

Breiter’s diagrams are rather a hindrance than a help. Du Fay's
distich gives Manilius’ scheme at a glance.

Of the three systems of which he here speaks, Manilius rejects the
simplest and most natural, namely the last (221-2). His rejection of
it is the more remarkable in that it seems to be the scheme of Posi-
donius ; cf. Theo. Smyrn. Hiller‚ p. 43, cited by Bouche-Leclercffi
