COMMENTARY 5-7

Claudian must, I think, have had these lines in mind when at Laus

Serenae 26—8 he wrote:
terrae pelagique labores

et saeui totidem bellis quot fluctibus anni
coniugii docuere fidem.

7. quoi: Scaliger long ago corrected to quoz at 888, where the MSS.
have quod, and again at 868, where they offer qui. Other passages
which point to the fact that Manilius wrote quoi not cuz are iii. 674 (qut
L ll) iv. 535 (qut codd. )‚ v. 743(czczsll). Birt, on Catalept0n‚ ib. 6, where
Haupt had emended qut of MSS. to qum, announces his intention os

‘forever repeating till people resolve to pay attention to it, that it is
salse to restore quoi for MSS. qui’. He points out that in the later
Empire 9ιιοι had ceased to exist, but that qqcz for cm is very frequent
in the texts of writers of that period, i. e. quz 'for c'uz is frequent precisely
in those texts in which quoi can never have had a place. If m such texts
one is content to restore everywhere cut for qui, why quot in Virgil or
Propertius, ‘for quot had already become cut in Republican times’
(p. 50). ² As a matter of fact quoi was still in use long after the time
not only of Virgil, but of Manilius. Quintilian i. 27 says that quoz
was taught to him as a boy, though the newer and better fashion of
writing it is cui. But in attributing quat to Manilius, I am guided not
primarily by the qut of xi. 868, iii. 674‚' ιν 5 35 but by the quae= que
= quo of 1i. 7, the quod(= qual, as ii. 4= quoz) of 868, and above all
by the cui' of v, 743. This last example is unmistakable. The
accident which has preserved it to us may be compared with that
which at Catullus xvii. 14 offers“ us cuz iocum stt GO for quot cum stt,
o or again at Cicero Fam. vii. 13. 1 quo m apicem sor 9ιιοι ne chena.
See F nednch s note upon Catullus lxiv. 219.

Conington at Virgil Ecl. iv. 62, though he does not write quoi, holds
that Quintilian had qum· ‘in his copy' and (Quint. ix 3. 8) mistook it
for qut. This is a case where Birt’ s protest is in point. Such a view
implies (1) that Quintilian had never seen but one ‘'copy of Virgil,
(2) that he was unsamiliar with quoi—a form perfectly well known to
him, (3) that he had never heard discussed the interpretation of this
muc’h· vexed passage. Yet this view is taken even by Munro (Lucret.
iv. 50). [Mumo l. c. thinks it possible that Lucretius (and Catullus)
wrote qut: cuz (cf. qfcm, qur). But inscriptions of the period have
always quoi, never cuz. See Lindsay Lat. Lang. pp. 445 sqq.]

cura petentum: the zeal of rival claimants to the honour of having
given birth to Homer. The old correction iura pelen& involves
making posteritas in 9 the subject of dabat and eripuit in 8· ‚ so
Gronovius, Breiter. This is intolerably harsh. Scaliger, followed by
Stoeber and Ellis, finds the subject of eripuit in ⁴ Homerus ’, referring
petenti (ab quo . . . petente, Ellis) to Ulysses. Of petendo (Bitteraus,
Kleinguenther) one is surprised that it should have occurred to two
scholars independently. On Bentley's patriam cul Graecia septem
Koestlin (who calls it a ‘glanzende und bewunderungswerthe
Besserung') bases a conjecture of his own p. cul iniuria septem
(Plulol. xl, p. 182).
