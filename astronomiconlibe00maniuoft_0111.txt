ASTRONOMICON 11

justice, the Scorpion for the stroke he dealt, the Lion for
his despoihng, the Crab for his bite, the Fishes by reason
of the transformation of Venus3 and the leader of all the
signs is the Ram, for his victory over the 563. And all
the other stars, they hold, revolve in fixed courses in the
height of heaven, dependent upon the diverse 11395 of their
earthly life. These are the poets by whose songs the
heaven has become a fairy-tale and the earth has fashioned
the sky on which it hangs.

The son of Sicily tells of the life of shepherds‚ and of
Pan shrilling upon the seed-pipe: 31161 10 1116 woods 116
sings 3 more than woodland strain, and through the rough
countryside sows his sweet notes, bringing the Muse to
the fields. Behold another that sings of painted birds and
warring beasts: and here one that tells of poison-bearing
serpentS‚ and there one that speaks of . . . herbs which carry
in their roots life and death. Furthermore, there are poets
who summon Hell itself into the daylight out of black
night and the gulf of shadows. Breaking through the fixed
ordinance of nature they unwrap and turn outwards the
inward parts of the world.

Every subject have the curious Muses set to song.

⁴ Every path that leads to Helicon is trodden bare: and by

now the waters of song flow sullied from their source, nor
do they suffice for those that would quaff them, and for the
crowd that throngs ever to the old themes. Let ns there-
fore follow over the dewy grass fresh meadow-lands and
fountains that murmur musingly in caverns retired, fountains
not yet touched by birds of steely beak, nor wasted by the
losty f1re of Phoebus himself. Ι will speak out of my own
wisdom, and the words of my mouth will 1 owe to none of
the singers before me. And there shall issue no stolen
strain‚ but all true work. I take my flight into the heavens
in a car none other shares. In my own ship 5311 Ι 1116
5635. For Ι shall sing of the strong silent thinking work
of nature, and of God interfused in earth and sky and 563
controlling in impartial covenant the mighty mass. Ishall
sing how the whole universe is alive with harmony upon
this side 31161 upon that, and is moved by the motions of
Reason, one spirit indwelling in all 115 93115, shedding its
dews upon the round world, swiftly speeding through all
things and fashioning the body of things to breathing life.
