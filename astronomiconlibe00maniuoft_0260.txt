11 945—65 COMMENTARY

there is no reason to think the planetary symbols as old as Manilius ⁹
(ib.).

Bentley, followed by Breiter, obelizes both lines. Of commenta-
tors, Bonincontrius has two notes: (1) ‘notaz sc. signo evidenti’;
(2) ‘notat quod artificio hominis praeest ille planeta' (Ι can make
nothing of these). Scaliger and Huet are, as Bentley notes, basely
silent ; Stoeber steals from Du Fay (who steals from F. Junius) a note
better left in its place. Bandini’s rendering ‘ o imagine col suo proprio
segno notata ’ leaves us where we were, Ellis alone, in a learned note,
really faces the passage. (With his note cf. Mart. Cap. 102 Eyssen-
hardt. ) Yet he ends by rejecting everything from quod (944) to artis
(945). Postgate favours the same rejection. ‘Rem de qua loqui'tur ,
he then says, ‘aeque mihz alque aliis ignotam esse f zteor ' But he goes
on to explain‘ θ’ as the first letter of the word Olympus— quae ducit
Olympum3 signata as= signata est; facies as the facade of Mercury' s
temple. [I n 945 my quae ui‘czt is, I think, a little nearer to the MSS.
and a little clearer than Ellis’ qua ducis]

946. in qua· . i.e. in qua m te.

947. et caelo: this is, Ι think, nearer than Scaliger‘s eque illa, and
gives much the same sense. Compare iii. 58 filla quoque et uitas
hominum suspendit ab astris. (For suspendit uota, in a somewhat
difficult sense, cf. Catull. lxiv. 104 tacito suspendit uota labellowwhere,
however, suspendit is only conjecturally restored.

948-58. Regio Occasus: which presides over old age and faithful
friendship. It is called Dilis Ianua.

949. mersat: mersit codd. Similarly at Verg. Aen. vi. 615 merset
Madvig3 mersit codd.

951. ne. Ihave retained the ne ofall MSS. ; see on 423. It is neces-
sary that Ι should at the same time point out—what is not clear from
editors—that from ne mirere to claudit in 954 there is no pause in sense,
nor should there be (were the line complete) more than a comma after
952-

nigri . . . Ditis ianua: cf. Verg. Aen. vi. 127 atri ianua Ditis;
Gratius Cyneg. 34 praeceps ianua Ditz’s3 see on 870.

952. et finem retinet uitae: the line is unfinished in GLM, save
that a later hand in G has added mortique locatur. Bentley ingeniously
corrects this to mortique dicatur. But to no purpose. For the
mortique of G is itself a blunder for [Martique. Martique locatur is
found in Bonincontrius (and in no earlier edition). That it was a con-
jecture of Bonincontrius himself, and passed to G from Bonincontrius,
may be regarded as certain. Soldati (Rivista di Fl'lologia xxviii,
p. 287) has called attention to a note in a copy of the Ed. Bononiensis
Bibl. Riccard. libri rari 431, which puts the matter beyond doubt. The
note is written by Bartolomeo della Fonte, and is as follows: ⁴ Martique
locatur putat addendum Laurentius: nam nullam de Marte [poeta]
mentionem fecit.'

Breiter’s insertion here of per tanta pericula mortis—which
appears in Μ in the form of a lemma after 901—has, necessitating
as it does the excision of the uitae of GLM, nothing to recommend it.

959. quae, Bentley, necessarily3 quas, with the MSS„ Breiter per-
versely.

964. in externis . . . hospita: for the antithesis Bonincontrius
compares Lucan v. 11 hospes in externis auditur (audiuit) curia tectis.

965. sub certa stellarum parte: not ‘ when I come to treat
specifically of the planets ’, parte, ‘ department ’ (as below 968, quoi parti,
