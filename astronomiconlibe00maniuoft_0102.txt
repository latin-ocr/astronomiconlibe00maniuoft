INTRODUCTION III

mention briefly the principal dissertations upon Manilius to which
I am conscious of owing anything.

The pamphlet literature upon Manilius opens auspiciously with
the name of Lachmann,1 whose treatise De Aetate Manilii was pub-
lished in 1815, and is most easily accessible in his Klez'ne Schriften,
vol. ii, p. 42, Berlin, 1876. Lachmann assigns the Astronomica
to the reign of Tiberius 3 and this essay is perhaps not particularly
valuablc to-day. But it would seem as though its republication in
1876 had given the stimulus to the considerable output ofliterature
upon the same subject which began in the eighties. ln 1880
B. Freier published at Gottingen a tract De stsam'lz'o Poeta, fol-
lowed in 1881 by the Groning programme—having the same
title—of J. Woltjer. Both pamphlets treat of the date of Manilius.
That of Freier may be regarded as the more considerable. It re-
affirms, as regards the date of Manilius, the position of Lachmann.²
Peculiar to Freier is the thesis that Manilius was a friend of
Germanicus and accompanied him to Germany. Freier holds that
IV. 209-12‚ 548-52 refer to Germanicus. But his exposition of
this view is vitiated by the fact that he confuses chronocrator and
horoscope (pp. 28, 33 sqq., 73 sqq.)—a confusion made by more
than one recent writer upon Manilius : see my note on ΙΙ. 507 sqq.
Nor is it easy to follow Freier, in referring Ι. 893—5 to events
in the reign of Tiberius. Surely philosophy, not history, is here in
question, and the allusion is to the Stoic doctrine of ἐκπύρωσις
(nouum . . . sepulcrum—Housman ementis—means ‘yet another
ἐκπύρωσις ’). Freier's views seem to have passed unchallenged
until Lanson's De Mamm) Poeta eiusque Ingenio. But, before
speaking of Lanson, Ι should—to sustain a chronological order—-
say something of a scholar who has, I think, been more useful to
students of Manilius than any other living critic. In 1882 there
appeared in Strasburg Adolf Cramer's De lllam‘lii qui fertur
Elocutz'wle. This work perhaps needs an Index, and its critical
presuppositions leave something to be desired. But it is an
invaluable work of reference upon all questions of metre, rhythni,
grammar, and diction. lts long array of V ergilian and Ovidian

¹ 1 pass by Jacob’s Lubeck programme of which I have spoken elsewhere.

(Jacob holds that I-IV of the Astronomica was written under Augustus,
V under Tiberius.)

2 That no part os this poem was written in the lisetime of Augustus.
Woltjer’s position is, with some differences, the same as that os Jacob.
