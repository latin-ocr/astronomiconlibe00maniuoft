THE THREE PRINCIPAL MSS.

1551 edition contains a collation of G, stated to be in Scaliger's
own hand. But this I suppose to be merely a transcript of
Susius’ notes; and it does not appear that Scaliger himself saw? G.
At any rate, he had not seen it in 1598. For he writes to Lipsius
in that year: ‘Exemplar quidem ipsum non uidi' (Burmann,
Syll„ i, p. 242, no. 233). G was employed by Sherburne: a note
in it records that it was sent for his use to a London bookseller
named Carr. Bentley for some time had the MS. in his possession.¹
An accident made Jacob dependent for his knowledge of it on
Susius and Bentley.2 In 1888 P. Thomas supplied the deficiencies
of previous collators. More recently Bechert and Breiter (twice)
have recollated G for their editions 3 and yet again Thielscher³
has been through the MS. and confesses that he can add nothing
of value to the collations of previous workers. Lastly‚ in 1907,
my friend Mr. C. T. H. Walker, of Corpus, recollated G, and has
been kind enough to put his notes at my disposal. They bear out
the testimony of Thielscher to the thoroughness with which G has

been examined.

, L, which belongs to the University Library of Leipsic (1465),⁴
is of an antiquity hardly, if at all, inferior to that of G. Two
young German scholars-Feller (in 1693) and Richter (in 1709)—
collated it for Bentley⁵ (who was the first editor to employ it).
L had, also been collated about 1692 by a son of Graevius.⁶
Jacob made a complete transcript of the MS„ and his Apparatus
records most of its variants. It was recollated by Bechert and

² Bechert for some reason denies this: loc. cit., p. 9. Yet 1 have before
me a copy of Scaliger's second edition which once belonged to Scaliger
himself, and subsequently to Bentley, in which is written in Bentley’s hand
‘ MS. Gemblacensis a me denuo collatus '. See Introduction, pp. xlvi-xlvii. 1f
Bechert could not know of this, he could at any rate have known of Bentley's
own words in Letters, cxxxi, p. 366 sq. : ‘ipse oculis meis diligentissime
olim perlustravi Gemblacensem et minutissimas quasque variationes scrupu-
lose notaui.’ Or, again, he could have read p. xiv of the Praefatio to
Bentley's edition. Instead of this he bases his statement on a note os
Stceber at IV. 637. Some other errors in Bechert's account of G are noted
in Thomas’ Lucubratz'ones.

² Jacob, Praef„ vii-viii.

³ Philol„ 1907, p. 126.

⁴ The library number is given wrongly by Housman, Praes„ vii.

⁵ Bentley, Manil„ Praef, p. xiv; Epp.‚ cxxxi, p. 366; cxxxix, p. 385.

⁶ Bentl., Epp., xxi, p. 443 J. Vierschrot also collated it. See Stoeber,
Praegfi, p. 16 ; Bechert, C. R„ 1900, p. 302. Richter's collation may still be
seen in the British Museum‚ in a copy of ed. Boecleriana.
