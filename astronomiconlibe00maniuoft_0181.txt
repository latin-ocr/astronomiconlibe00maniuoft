COMMENTARY 83—91

progression from ψιλὴ ἕξις, inorganic nature, to φύσις, plants, ἀι, to
ψυχή ἱη beasts‚ to ψυχή —l- νοῦς Or ψυχὴ λόγον ἔχουσα in man. See
Sext. Mam. ix. 81.

83. ducit: regit, gubernat, Du Fay. No, ‘derives’: the deus-et-
ratio derives the living creatures of earth from the constellations; as
i. 18 generetque suis animalia szgrnz's. The stars are simply said to
give birth to living things as men born under this or that star are said
elsewhere (e. g. 5, 6) to be born from it. Both Breiter and PingreZ,
however, take ducit ab as ‘makes dependent on ’; but why should
it, and how can it, mean this?

84. quae mgna, quamquam longo recessu sunt summota, tamen
sentiri cogit. I see no difficulty here. Yet Bentley, followed by
Breiter, puts a comma at recessu, and explains sentiri as infinitiuo
modo absolute s lzoc est sentiri tamen facit uel possunt. Ellis prefers to
take the sentence as Ι have taken it; though he thinks it possible
that sentiri is inf. in Or. Obl. and posse ad opiniones referri quae
uersibus 8213 traduntur. But he rightly calls this durior structura.
Placing a comma at recessu, Bentley emends cogit to condz‘t; cf.
ii. 374. Ellis renders cogit by stipam Breiter offers no interpretation ς
‘draws into relation with one another’ (iu consensum cogit, almost)
seems more likely than stipat.

longo summ. recessu: cf. 681 and iv. 861. recessus merely
‘distance '‚ as Lucan iii. 477 ex longo missa recessu. Verg. Aen.
viii. 193 spelunca . . . uasto summota recessu is somewhat different.

87. nimis: no better defence of the MSS. minus is offered than
that of Bonincontrius, who explains, quamuis sigua et stellae fizciant
quae dim'mus corpora, nen tamen minus est quaerenda fides a deo

⁴ tanquam a datore omnium. Ι have accepted, therefore, Bentley⁷s

nimis, though Ι do not feel it to be entirely apt. I at one time
conjectured procul, supposing miuus to be a gloss eminus, indicating
that procul should be taken not as ‘ far away '‚ but ‘from far away ’.

89. sic pontum mouet: on the phenomenon of the tides as a stock
proof for astrologers of the ξυμπάθεια of the universe see Aulus Gellius
xiv. 1. 3 ; Firmicus i. 4. 4 dic milzi quis in caelo iter maris uidit (where
Dressel’s Alartis is an incredible conjecture).

90-2. haec seditio (90) = seditio ex eo orta quod alternatim pontus
immittitur et aufertur3 i. e. haec seditio means little more than ‘the
phenomenon of the tides ’. The tides affect, or ‘possess ’, the sea at
one time under the influence of the full moon (sidere lunae = when
the earth gets the moon’s light), at another time under the influence
ot the moon's withdrawal to the opposite quarter of the heaven, i. e. to
that quarter where it is no longer a sidus to the observer on earth. It
is at the full, is a complete sidus, when it is furthest from the sun.
Its diuersus recessus, its withdrawal to an opposite position, lies in the
point at which it is nearest to the sun and not seen from the earth.
Manilius means, therefore (90-1)‚ that the sea is affected by the tides
at the full moon and the new moon. These are, in fact, the tides
which would attract the observation of a dweller on the Mediterranean ;
the others, so noticeable to us, would hardly count for him. (The
ancients remarked the immense tides in Britain, Pliny N. Η. ii.
97, 218·)

90-1‚ then, simply say that there are lunar tides, specifying the two
most noticeable——those at the full and the new moon. The other lunar
tides, however, are accounted for in 92, which merely notes the effect
of the sun in counteracting the attraction of the moon. The sun and
