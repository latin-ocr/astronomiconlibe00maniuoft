COMMENTARY 747-9

note), i. 332 (read cingentem with Breiter‚ δια), ἰν. 445 read illi cst.
The elision of sese at iv. 831, ν. 198 is really elision of se. At v. 656
the true reading is past recovery.

Of mediate syllables elided in disyllabic words only two examples
are alleged. Of those no one will defend enim an at ii. 347. At i. 90
1 am inclined to suggest semper ut. Ergo‘, τιενό, quando* are regarded
by Manilius as trochees. Similarly leo* et at ii. 229 (the normal
scansion in Manilius).

The whole subject of the elision of long syllables in Latin poets
generally needs complete re—investigation. In the Jcncrnal of Philo-
logy, 1906, pp. 90—4‚ I have tried to show how utterly erroneous are
current views upon the subject as far as hendecasyllabic verse is con-
cerned. ln the Classical chczrterly‚ 1910, pp. 121—2‚ 1 have tried to
correct inadequate ideas on the elision of the last syllable of a pure
iambic word (in the dactylic and tragic poets). 1 may be allowed
here, perhaps, to call attention to certain broad principles governing
the elision in Latin poetry of long and mediate syllables.

The Roman poets avoid the elision of a long, or mediate, syllable
save (1) before a monosyllable3 (2) before a word of which the first
syllable is, or has the appearance of, a monosyllabic preposition, as
e. g. emitto, insignis 3 in this class may also be reckoned such words
as amplexus, optatus, antiquu53 (3) when the syllable elided is itself
a monosyllabic word; (4) when either colliding syllable is a particle,
conjunction, preposition, pronoun, or other word in very common use
in daily speech, as e. g. hic, ille, τῷδε, is, ego, idem, alius, aliquis, alter,
&C., and their parts3 age, equidem, enim, eliam, adeo, iuter, uhi,
autem, ἃς. ; unus, omnis ; uerum, tantum, solum, certe, quando, supra,
frustra. To these must be added a few very common substantives‚ as
e. g. in Vergil homines, oculus, animum (5) when either colliding word
is a proper name. Vergil delights in this kind of elision, and his
pleasure in it is notable, since in all our other four cases the elision is
apparently conditioned by the slurring in ordinary pronunciation of
very common words.

Elisions not covered by these cases will be found, 1 fancy,
extremely few. In Vergil l have noted in the Eclagues but 5 excep-
tions ; in Cem‘g. i. 7, in Aen. i. 9, in Aen. ii. 14, in Aen. xii. 14 (nearly
always -i-0 -ae‚ very rarely -u -ἐ -ιῖ) ; in Ciris 3 3 in Culex 0 ; in cicero,
Arat. 3 ; in Catullus (hexameters) 4 (Ρ 5). Even in Lucretius 1 fancy
that the percentage is only about two exceptions in 100 lines. lt is,
moreover‚ noteworthy that these exceptions <particularly is this true of
Vergil) are most frequent where the two colliding words form one
phrase (e. g. longo ordine, ferri acies). The long vowel oftenest elided
is, I fancy, -ί, The figures which I have given do not pretend to be
more than approximately accurate; but I offer them in the hope that
some one may be stimulated to produce lists at once fuller and more
exact; and in order to call attention to the fact that what has above
all to be considered upon the subject of elision is the character of the
colliding words. Elision is just a slurring of pronunciation ; and with
the Latins, as with us, such slurring is commonest in the case of words
in familiar use.
