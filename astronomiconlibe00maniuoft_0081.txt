MANILIUS AND HIS EDITORS

F ew have attracted the abilities of such great editors. It is not too
much to say that Manilius will always be read, not only sor his
own virtues, but for those of the scholars who have busied them-
selves with him. Of the work of some of these Ι may be allowed
here within the limits of my knowledge to attempt some estimate.
Ι feel the more induced to do this since an exacting and lively
critic has recently passed the work of all of them under review,
with a good deal of extravagance of judgement‚ and in some
cases with a perverse injustice.

The earliest of the printed editions of Manilius is now generally
agreed to be that of Regiomontanus, or—to give him his modern
name—Johann Mueller of Konigsberg, the pupil of Purbach and
the foremost astronomer of the fifteenth century. Ι have else-
where¹ made some conjecture as to the circumstances under
which this edition was executed 01· conceived. To what Ι have
there said 1 have here little to add. The edition of Regio-
montanus belongs probably to the year 1474. In that year died
Janus Pannonius, one of the circle of Hungarian humanists with
whom Regiomontanus was connected. Among the friends of
Janus Pannonius was Marsiglio Ficino (who dedicated to him his
'translation of Plato's Symposium). Not only was Ficino himself
an astrologer (he had translated in 146 3 the Hermes Trzkmegtktus),
but he was an intimate friend of tlie first commentator upon
Manilius—Bonincontrius.² This indirect connexion between
the first editor and the first expositor of Manilius is, I think, not
without interest for Manilian students. Regiomontanus seems to
have taken rather lightly the duty of preparing the first printed
text of our author. Ι know the Florentine MS. Lam. plut. Jj, 15
only from the citations from it in Bechert⁷s text. But I should not
be surprised to find, from a fuller knowledge of it, that Regiomon-
tanus' text is (save for a good many crude, and one or two elever,
conjectures 3) substantially the same as that of the Laurentianus.
In any case this edition is not only unscholarly‚ but it is a work
discreditable to a man of any gifts⁷ conscience, or reputation.

And the same is true of the edition which was long regarded as
the editio pm'nceps-——the Bononiensis. Cramer is probably right

¹ C. 9., iii. 1, pp. 54—5. ² Muratori‚ R. I. 5., xxxi. 4.

³ ln Book 11 we owe to Regiomontanus the truc reading in some thirty
places ; but the corrections are mostly trivia1‚ and some come possibly from
the codd. dcte.
