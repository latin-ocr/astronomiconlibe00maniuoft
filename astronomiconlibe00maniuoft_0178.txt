II 48 COMMENTARY

Eusebius’ account of Valerian (H. E. 480== 331-2) the similar mention
of the murder of boys. But of necromancy, as such, there was a per·
missa fizcultas down to Christian times. The laws of maiestas and
the Lex Cornelia de sicariis were, under the Empemrs, extended in
such a way that they applied to certain offences arising out of necro-
mancy. But the art, or science, was not in itself a crime. It was, in
fact, precisely on a footing with astrology.¹ Firmicus (ii. 30. 4) warns
the astrologer not to inquire de statu respublicae uel de uita impera-
toris, and the necromancer in an earlier period had to observe the
same circumspectiori (cf. Ammian. Marc. xxix. init„ though here of
Magic only). Both were diviners ; but so long as they divined nothing
which was injurious to the state, or its chief, or which threatened the
lise or fortunes of individuals, the law (the senatus consulta) touched
neither of them. Under the Christian emperors interference went further.
Yet Christianity and necromancy were not originally thus antagonistic.
Justin (Apol. i. 18, noticed above) argues from the pagan belief in
necromancy to the Christian doctrine of immortality; and in Dial.
Tryplz. 105 he recalls the Witch of Endor to like purpose. (In con-
trast cf. Tertullian De Anima 573 Apologet. 23 2·nz't.).² In Firmicus
i. 2. 11 necromancy is classed with sacrilege, murder, incest, pae-
derasty :—illum quiescentium securas animas et iam Lethaei fluminis
obliuione purgatas Mercurius cogit nefariis carminibus excitare3 but
the astrologer is not responsible for the necromant.

Among non-Christian sources for necromancy in the ancient world
the most important are pseudo—Quintilian Declamatio xi—of uncertain
date—and Apuleius de Affagea.

43. Bentley's saecla for bella is perhaps right.

44—5. uenenatos anguis: Verg. Aen. vii. 753 sqq. uipereo generi
et grauiter spirantibus hydris spargere qui somnos cantuque manuque
solebat mulcebatque iras et morsus arte leuabat.

†nata pert herbas: perhaps damna per herba53 damna is used
in the poets for almost any injury, in particular disease or plague‚ e. g.
ovid Pont. i. 10. 29. damna written dala (as iv. 20 damno for dato
codd.) may have been corrected metri gratia to the nata of our MSS.
nata is obviously corrupt. The old way of construing it, ‘the death
and life born os plants bearing death and life in their roots' (sata
uitamque ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with nata and serentis) is altogether intolerable.
If the words, as they stand, have any construction, it must be refert ea
quae nascuntur per herbas quae sata uitamque sua radice ferunt
(Seneca Phoen. 149 herbas quae ferunt letum auferes ξ’). Bentley's
gramina et herbas is palaeographically poor. Breiter’s prata per
herbas, palaeographically better, stands condemned, as Breiter rnust
know, by 53.

46. Tartaron atra: Tartara nalra (nacla) cozbi. For a similar
confusion arising from the Greek acc. cf. Culex 270 Cet-bera nunquam
most codd. sor Cerberon unquam; Germ. 385 Gargara nauti deus sor
Gargaron aztt Ide.

46—8. Cf. i. 93-4.

47. reuoluunt: cf. Aetna 75 (Scaliger).

¹ Cf. Prudentius Symmach. ii. 894 inuoluit mathesi, magicas impellit in
artes. Similarly Hermes, the inventor of Astrology, is the father of Magic3
id. Symm. i. 84 sqq.

² where, perhaps, eliciunt for edum: pucros elidunt is sound enough,
and the reference is as in Justin Apol. i. 18; Euseb. loc. ‹-2·t.; Hor. Epod.
above.
