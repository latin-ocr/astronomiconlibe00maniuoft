ASTRONOMICON 11

that which at their journey’s end hides the stars, and,
governing the Setting Heaven‚ beholds the sky submerged ;
this post has its business in consummations and the end of
labours‚ marriages, banquets, and the last days of lise, and
ease and the minglings of men and the service of the gods.

It is not enough to observe merely the cardinal point, be
it which it may. We must note also and bear in mind the
regions between the cardinal points: in the wider area
which they cover these mid-regions have their proper
influences. All that winding region which extends from
the Rising Heaven to the highest point of the sky controls
the first years of life and growth. The region which is
beneath the summit os the world and slopes ever downward
till it comes to the Setting Heaven has the tutelage of
childhood, and its judgernent—seat governs early youth.
That part which, touching the Setting Heaven‚ descends
below the world, governs the seasons of full-grown life with
all that they have to bear both from the natural passage of
years and from the broken course of fortune. But where
the line of the sky returning from the depth, climbs slowly
over the sinking and outworn circle and finishes its course,
this last region embraces our latest years and ‘che declining
clay of life and palsied eld.

Every sign, whatsoever its configuration, takes the
infection of the region of heaven wherein it dwells. Position
governs the stars and gives to them their power of boon or
bane. Each of them revolves, and, revolving, receives
powers from the heavens and renders them. For the nature
of the sky gives to thern within its confines their qualities
and their law, and compels the signs as they pass to be of
its own character3 and now it is rich with diversity of glory,
now barren, and the signs bear the penalty of the region
wherein they sojourn.

That region which is above the Rising Heaven‚ the third
in order from the summit of the sky, is a region unblessed‚
full of bale for the future, all too fertile of harm. Nor that
region alone: like unto it is the house which shines with
opposed star, next neighbour to, and beneath‚ the Setting
Heaven. Albeit a cardinal house watches over each, yet is
each called the place of Despond, and ruin hangs over it.
These are the Gates of Toil: here do you climb, here fall.
