alliance and friendly influencc of these figures and to dis-
cover in related stars the bonds of the universe—that man
will be deceived. For even though you get in every case
sets of five signs, yet the men that are born from signs
placed each in the fifth place, will not be able to feel the
influence of a triangle, though they may speak of a triangle.
They have lost their lot owing to an error in position, and
their numbers will be at fault. For there are 360 divisions
of the world traversed by the burning sun ; and a third of
that number goes to a single side of a triangle drawn through
the signs. But your line does not give you this number isit
be drawn merely from sign to sign and not from division to
division. Because, although you may have two stars
separated by three intervening stars‚ yet if you care to
connect the last point of the left star and the first point of
the preceding star and to count the number of divisions⁷
the two points will give you a total of 150 divisions. The
number, that is, will be too great for the form and will
encroach upon the territory of the line that follows. And
so, though you may speak of triangles, your figures will not
sustain the part of triangles.
Δ The same deception will meet you in the quadrangular
figures. Of the total number of degrees which make up
the Zodiacal Circle ninety give you the side of your starry
square. But you find that if your line be drawn from the
first degree of the preceding sign to the last degree of the
following sign you get a result of 120 degrees. And again,
if you join the last degree of the preceding and the first
degree of the following sign, your line both omits and
gives to you the number of degrees of the two signs between
its two points: that is to say, it gives you twice thirty
degrees, but the third set of thirty degrees will be wanting :
and however much one may count from a given sign to the
fourth sign from it, the degrees in their own adding will
make shipwreck osa whole sign. It is therefore not enough
to reckon triangles by drawing your line from sign to sign,
nor to reckon a square as true and just if its line includes
four heavenly signs. If you should wish to construct the
outline of a square, or think to represent the figure of an
equilateral triangle, for the triangle you must add to a
