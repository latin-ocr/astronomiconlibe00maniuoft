INTRODUCTION 111

expertus in Raphaele¹ Cardinali Sancti Georgii, qui ad Cardinala-
tum uenit, et sorte ad Pontificatum, cum directo illius stellae ad
gradum decime, peruenerit! He tells us, in the Preface to his
Commentary, that he was the first scholar in Italy who lectured
upon Manilius 3 and he twice assures us that his lectures were
attended by large and enthusiastic audiences. The Commentary
was published in the year 14843 and, save for the Fasti (Rome,
1491), it was the only work of Bonincontrius which appeared
during his lifetime. The Fasti is a small volume of verse in
which Sapphics alternate with Elegiacs‚ and the Christian religion
becomes inextricably mixed with the pagan mythology of the
stars. Some of the verse is not without grace, but there is no
approach to real accomplishment, nor are the pieces metrically
faultless.² But Bonincontrius’ most notable work is the long
hexameter poem Rerum Naturalium et Dim'narum siue de Rebus
caelestibus. Its editor, L. Gauricus³ (himself an astrologer)‚
speaks of it as ‘paene diuinum opusculum' (p. i), and Ficino
calls its author, elegantly, ‘poeta astronomicus astronomusque
poeticus '. The elder Scaliger, whose son so much despised
Bonineontrius, allows to the poem some merits.⁴ The student
of Manilius may still be interested to glance through it and to
observe the degree to which Bonincontrius has conserved‚ or
transformed‚ the language and ideas of Manilius.⁵ In prose Bonin-
contrius wrote—in the annalistic style—a History of Florence and
a work De Orlu Mapolitanormn Regum, both published post-
humously. More interesting to Manilian students is a small
astrological handbook‚ entitled Tractatus Electionum, forming
a part of the Opusculum Astrologicnm of Johann Schoner os
Karlstadt, published at Nuremberg in 1539. This and his two
poetical works help to explain both the defects and the merits,
such as they are, of Bonincontrius’ Commentary. Like de l'Isle,

¹ Raphael Riario, or Galeotto, to whom the Commentary is dedicated
sperhaps the ‘Cardinalem Quendam' of the Tractatus Electionum). He was
born in 1451 and died in 1521.

² e. g. at iii. x. 42 he ends a pentameter with the word ὅ Heroides ³.

³ Gauricus forms an interesting link between Bonincontrius and Scaliger.
J. C. Scaliger kept ζ aluit et fhm't) two astrologers at his house, os whom
Gauricus was one and Pomponatius another: Prima Scaltgeriana, p. 107.

⁴ Poet. vi. 3, p. 308, Venice, 1561, ‘Argumento stylus est longe inferior.
Non pauca tamen placere possunt?
