ΙΙ 322—34 COMMENTARY

{caldata-tages quadra as fem. sing.‚ comparing Mantum 493 Mart.
ap. vni. 23.

All these emendations, however, leave untouched two difficulties:
(1) quadrum(a) means a square3 and here has, apparently, to be
interpreted as one side, or line, of a square (latus unum, 309) 3 (2) per
sidera is left with almost no meaning. Comparing 307-11 I arn
inclined to suspect that sidera has usurped the place of linea, and
that we ought perhaps to write something like tnginta quadri partes
ter linea reddat.

326. confertur: as 315 con erre.

subeuntis = laeui: I can find no parallel for subiuncti (Regio-
montanus) in this sense, though editors print it without comment.

327. transitque refertque: transire is to ⁴ pass over' in the sense
of ‘leave out ⁸, ‘omit', as 368 transita szgna. transitque refertque
accordingly means et omittit et reddit. The line drawn et omittit et
reddit duorum signorum in medio numerum. The numerus of the
duo szgrna in medio is of course 60 degrees. The line omits 60 degrees
in that the other line (323-5)‚ with which Manilius is contrasting it, gave
120 degrees; and since it omits 60 degrees, and since 120-60 = 60,
it also gives—refert, reddit—60 degrees3 and, lest anybody's arith-
metic should fail him, Manilius adds in 328 that it ‘doubles thirty
degoees, and a third (of its just number) is still wanting to it ’.

Only Bentley among editors seems to have seen the meaning of
the line. Breiter renders transit by ‘durchlauft ’, refertque by ⁴ und
giebt sie auch an ’, in which 1 see no meaning. Housman reads
transique referque, which alters the text without touching the difficulty.
Bentley regards in medio as corrupt3 but I doubt if it is to be altered.
By ‘both omits and returns the number of the two signs between its
two points ’ Manilius means merely the number 30. If he had written
parles for numerum, then, no doubt, there would have been the contra-
diction which Bentley finds. No doubt also the sense would have been
clearer if the words in medio had been altogether omitted.

330. unius: sc. signi, i. e. 30 degrees.

331-57. The line of a triangle must cover 120 degreeS, os a square
90 degrees. The signs of a triangle or square (when either is con-
structed according to their numerical laws) have affinity with one
another—have communi foedera lege (340) ς and those born under these
signs feel the influence of these ties. The influence of tri-angles is,
however, greater than that of squares.

331. signis: by drawing your line from sign to sign rather than
from a given degree in one sign to the same degree in another3 in
fact signis is put for the sagnz'lz'ter of later writers, and Bentley’s
ingenious quinis is hardly necessary.

332. caeli: quaeri Bentley, followed by Housman; and I am not
prepared to say that this is not right ; though fidem quaerat in 591 q. v.
is used somewhat differently. If caeli is right it is best to connect it
with szgmz. The phrase fidem caeli has no support from 452, where
the true reading is caelo. Stoeber astonishingly interprets fidem as
= lineam, comparing Chelarumque fides in iii. 305 (where fides
== iustitz'a3 cf. Luc. iv. 58 iustae pondera Librae).

If the text is sound 1 suppose that numerare fidem quadrati per
{tgnaquaterna means ‘to reckon a triangle reliable if its line covers

our signs'.

333. formam, as at 317 =figuram.

334. partibus aut trinis : see App. Crit. ; editors take the paribus
