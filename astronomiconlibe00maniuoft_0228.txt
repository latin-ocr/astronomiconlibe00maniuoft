ΙΙ 509-32 COMMENTARY

gemtus sub pondere L ibnze. [Sherburne ιε reduced to supposing that
Augustus was born at nzglzt, and that Suetonius was here in error.
Among rulers who have been born under the royal sign of Capricorn
Sherburne enumerates ‘Charles v, Francis i of France, Charles of
Bourbon‚ Cosmo de Medici, and Solimus the great Turke' .]

510. auribus . . . captat: apparently = audzffre and so captare,
with some such word as sonzlum following, is used in Comedy.1n
the present passage, somtus captare Canen would be readily
intelligible3 but attrzbus captare fizstz'oza is so strange an expression
as to bring the text into suspicion.

summi fastigia Cancri: the Sun' m Cancer reaches the highest
point in the Ecliptic; Lucan iv. 526—7 nam sol Ledaea tenebat sidera,
m'cz'no cum lux altissima Cancro est; Germ. Arat. 449 sqq. hoc
Cancrum letzjgrit cnm Titan orbe timeto aestatem rabidam et soluentz‘s
corpora morbos .· tunc habet aeterni cursus saslzgz'a summa.

521-38. The signs os alternate triangles are hostile to one another
(521—2). This principle Manilius illustrates in the case of the first
and third triangles‚ where the causes of hostility are most clearly
seen (523 —38). b'But it follows necessarily from 520- 2 that the same
principle governs the relations of the second and fourth triangles
also—quamam spatio exclusus de posterioribus lzz's ni'lzzl discent
(Ellis). In what follows—539-4o—Manilius says that though all
signs obey this law of triangular opposition‚ yet a good many of them
wage wars of their own ( priuata arma); and in 541-69 he gives a
list of all the enmities of each sign, whether private enmities or
enmities arising out of triangular situation. For the difficulties
connected with this list see note on 541.

520. quin etiam ipsa meant aduersa: so I have tried to restore
the corrupt quin aduersa meant etiam (etiamv L). [ipsa = ipa was
lost after elz‘d.]¹ The loves and hates of individual signs have just
been mentioned ; we now find that ipsa trigona are hostile.

521—2. ‘And it is the alternate line that leads them to war along
opposed paths.’ The line drawn from e. g. Gemini to Libra is
alternate to, = separated by one from, = altera t0, the line drawn
from Aries to Leo; and so the triangle that stands on the line drawn
from Gemini to Libra is hostile to that which stands on the line from
Aries to Leo.

diuerso limite: because the first sign of the first triangle is
diametrically opposed to the first of the third, the second to the
second, and so on ; these signs are loco contraria (as noted in 527).
522. Cf. C ulex 4 omnis ul historiae per ludum consonet ordo.
525. quod = quod trzjgonum.
excipiunt, ‘carry on ³, ‘receive from Chelae and continue '.
So I suppose, sor editors are silent. But the expression excipere
trzjgonum has no parallel elsewhere; and the natural way of taking
the construction is negant Chelis foedus quod excipiunt Gemini—i. e.
thesoedus denied to Libra falls to Gemini.

526. uerum : ‘in accordance with reason ’ς Cic.

531-2. ‘Leo shines among the stars as having been vanquished—by
Hercules, a man-and it was his golden fleece-of which he was
despoiled by Phrixus, a man—that gave to Aries his place among the
stars.’

¹ Or perhaps L's elz'amq. points to elz'amszcz, as Catullus lxxvi. 11 leque
reducis codd. for le ipse reducis.
