ASTRONOMICON II

the Maid, winter with the Archer‚ spring with the Fishes.
Three signs are assigned to each of the four divisions of
the year. The winter signs are at strife with the summer
ones, the vernal with the autumnal.

It is not sufficient to know the configurations peculiar to
individual signs. They make alliances one with another
and gladly confederate themselves, controlling so our
destinies, and aid other signS, now these, now those,
according to their position and assignment. At the last
point in the Zodiac, where its course doses, the line of
the Circle runs off into three equal straight lines and joins
itself to three points in the circumference which are each
the furthest point possible from one another. Whatever
signs it strikes are called triangular because an angle is
thrice made, and is assigned to three stars which remain
separated from one another by three intervening signs.
The Ram beholds the two signs of the Lion and the
Archer, signs equidistant from him and rising on opposite
sides of him. The signs of the Maid and the Bull are in
concert with Capricorn. The other triangular signs are
ordered upon the same principle: they have their fixed place
in the heaven at distances separated by the same number of
’ degrees. But it will make a difference if the signs are classed
as right signs : left signs are those that follow: those that
precede are called right signs. Capricorn is a right sign to
the BuIl, the Maid a left sign. This may suffice for an
example. But those signs which, divided into sets of four,
are stationed on an equilateral figure, and whose places are
mapped out by perpendicular lines—these signs they call
quadrangular. Capricorn gazes on the Balance‚ the Ram
on Capricorn, the Ram himself at an equal distance is
beheld by the Crab, and the Crab by the stars of the
Balance that follows him on the left 3 for signs that precede
are always classed as right signs. Thus it is possible to
distribute all the signs into like divisions, and of the twelve
to fashion three squares. Of these squares I will expound
the influences in order due.

If a man is content to reckon squares in such a way as
merely to suppose the sky divided according to sets of four
signS, or to suppose that any three signs divided according
to sets of five make a triangle———hoping thus to attain the
