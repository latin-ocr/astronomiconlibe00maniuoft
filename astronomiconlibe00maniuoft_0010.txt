PREFACE

The present Text, Commentary‚ and Translation, together
with the Introductions prefixed to them, are designed to
carry the casual student over Book II into clearer regions
(though Book III might be clearer than it is) with less eost
to his time and patience than he must ordinarily incur.
The Translation attempts to give an accurate rendering os
the Latin, and makes little pretension to literary quality.
Indeed, the character of Manilius’ Latin is such that the
helpfulness of a translation is not unlikely to be in inverse
proportion to its readableness. The temptation to para-
phrase is very strong. Yet any one who has constantly
used Pingre': will be aware of the disadvantages of this kind
of rendering, and will perhaps be tolerant of a version in
which literary form is deliberately subordinated to utility.
Even when Manilius is not employing technical language
his sentences are often strangely intractable. Any one
who will trouble to make for himself a rendering of the
first nine lines of this book will know at once what 1 mean.
His technicalities‚ moreover‚ are perhaps more embarrassing
than those of any other author who has tried to versify
a scientific terminology. What skill and sympathy can
achieve in the translation of Lucretius Mr. Cyril Bailey
has recently taught us. But we have yet to learn how to
deal with a poet who versifies the multiplication-table and
sets to the measure of Vergil the reasonings of Euclid.
One particular difficulty 1 may be allowed here to mention,
towards which I have not attempted to take up a consistent
attitude. Qnarla segma in Manilius are, in accordance with
an inclusive method os reckoning common in Roman
writers, signs separated from one another by two inter-
vening signs. The clear sense of such a phrase can only
be hit by a rigmarole. But I have found it in practice not
possible to maintain throughout a single rigmarole for each
such phrase as it recurs in a variety of contexts.

In my CommentaryI have made it my first obJect to
interpret Manilius by himself—to find out what he wrote
and to explain that. The understanding of him has, I
think, recently been somewhat retarded by an over-anxiety
