COMMENTARY 142—50

meatuum). Ellis, however, finds the antecedent to quibus in carmina
(142) (Hernmthena‚ 1893, p. 263 sqq.). Bonincontrius takes sacr.
meatus apparently as = meare inter sacra astra.

per orbem, ‘on earth) See on 138. The twofold sense of orbis,
‘earth’ and ‘heaven '‚ is sometimes a source of confusion in other
authors than Manilius. Thus, at Seneca, Herc, Oet. 844 (reddendus
orbi est), orbi means ‘ heaven ' and not—as Leo apparently, i, p. 53—
‘ earth '.

fluit : Du F ay, Bentley, δια, take fluit as z abundat, numerosa cst,
which Bentley, of course, sees to be impossible3 ‘hat keine feste
Richtung, schwankt haltungslos‚’ Breiter, comparing iii. 524, iv. 377,
which are in no sort parallel ; ‘fleets on unconcernedly,' Ellis. fluit, if
genuine, must, I think, be = peril or lent.- perit, for which sense see
L. δι S. s. v. Of emendations,sugit is, in the context, meaningless,fi‘e-
quens palaeographically useless.

Bentley obelizes this and the two succeeding lines ; this, on account
(1) of fluit; (2) of the tautology diuitias. . . aurum—which might
perhaps be got rid of by writing aulam for aurum-the succeeding
line for no reason at all, 147 on account of aduersa, of which diuersa
seems a satisfactory correction. Ellis's diuisa is based on Hor. Od. i.
15. 15 carmina dsm'des. Breiter's retention of aduersa passes belief.
At 287 the MSS. vary between diuersa, aduersa, (ἰωὴ-ω cf. Stoeber

150—269. Manilius now passes to a classification of the signs of the
Zodiac. His classification has its basis for the most part in nothing
more scientific than the configuration of the signs as pictorially pre-
sented. Bouche-Leclercq says truly: ‘Rien ne montre mieux sans
doute l’ineptie fonciere et incurable——mettons la naivete-de gens qui
prenaient pour oeuvre de nature, susceptible d’engendrer des rapports
naturels‚ le produit de la fantaisie la plus capricieuse ' (Astr. Gr.
p. 149). The classification, however, into masculine and feminine, and
again that into nocturnal and diurnal‚ forms an exception, being based
on geometrical principles. Geometrical principles likewise determine
the position assigned to Virgo in 175 sqq. The system followed by
Ptolemy rejects the pictorial principle wholly, and has its basis purely
in geometr-y. And it is clear from Manilius ii. 175-96‚ 664—70 that he
knew the elassification adopted by Ptolemy. On the whole subject
see Bouche-Leclercq, pp. 149 sqq.

Manilius is concerned to specify the following classes (other divi-
sions and subdivisions are found in other astrological writers) 2—(1) mas-
culine or feminine, 150—43 (2) human or bestial, 155-83 (3) single or
double, 159-96; (4) auersa or recta, 197—202 ; (5) nocturnal or diurnal,
203—223 (6) marina, terrena, or ambigua, 22 3—32; (7) fecunda, sterilia,
or communia, 233—433 (8) currentia, stantia, sedentia or iacentia,
244—55 ; (9) mutila or integra, 2 56-64 3 (10) uerna, aestiua, autumnalia
or hiberna, 265-9.

Breiter follows Boll in making Asclepiades of Myrlea (100 Β. C.)
one of Manilius’ sources here. But many of the classes recognized in
Asclepiades are absent from Manilius, and in the paucity of astrological
remains of a date prior to Manilius it seems dangerous to regard as
