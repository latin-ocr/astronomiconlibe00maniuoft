ASTRONOMICON II

the signs of affinity: they assist the near degrees of
relationship, and protect those born under a single sign . . .
Yet these signs, although they divide the Circle into four
parts and form squares, are not reckoned as under the law
of squares. For the value of a numerical relation is less
than that of a cardinal relation.

Thus all the signs which have their established place in
the precincts of a heavenly square have a like lot either
from their numerica] relation to one another or from their
relation to the seasons.

The line which, covering three signs, makes their stars
into a triangle is longer, and embraces a wider area than
the line of the square. It conducts us to friendships which
are wellnigh as strong in degree as ties of blood, and to
affections that knit heart to heart. Just as the signs unite
with one another across a vast intervening space, so they
unite ns across distances greater than those that separate
kin. These signs men believe to be kinder and of more
avail to unite men's spirits than those which, though they
govern ties of blood, are yet so often false to the union they
control. Signs which are next to one another aid neighbours,
signs alternately placed guests. So will you find the order
> of the stars faithfully reflected in their workings.

But you must also assign to the constellations those parts
of other signs which belong to them, and to these parts
again their proper planets. For nothing lives to itself alone.
The signs combine as they move in heaven. To the actual
planets they assign their provinces, and in their turn they
reccive what belongs to themselves. These things will
Ι set before you in detail anon; they shall appear to you
in their fixed order. From all of them must wc by our
science draw true reasonings: that so you may be able to
distinguish signs which are friendly from those which are
hostile. Be content now to observe a phenomenon trivial
in appearance but of mighty import. It allows of being
noted only under a Greek name. I speak of the dode-
catemories: the name itself explains the principle. Every
sign consists of thirty degrees: divide this number by
twelve: a simple calculation shows you that you then
have twelve divisions each of two and a half degrees. This
is the measure of the province of a dodecatemory. There
are twelve dodecatemories‚ then, in each sign. And the
mighty builder of the sky has assigned one of these to each
