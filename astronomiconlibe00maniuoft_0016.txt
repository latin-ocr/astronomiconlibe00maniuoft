PREFACE

among ‘second-rate authors '. Bentley, after all, wentv so
far as to say that Manilius and Ovid alone among the
Latins possessed ‘wit ’. What exactly Bentley understood
here by ‘ wit’ Ι do not undertake to say. But Ι cannot
take leave of Manilius without expressing the sense which
I have of the fine poetical quality of much of his work.
He possesses something more valuable to a poet than wit—-
personality. He is a clear soul in a turbid age, and a poet
whose utterance is still genuine and fresh in a period of
fagtitious speech. To one or two sentiments that are a
permanent part of all reflection in confused and sceptical
times he has given beautiful expression. No one among
the ancients has drawn out more movingly the contrast
between the disorder of human history and the calm and
continuity of the workings of nature. When the Greeks
overthrew Troy, already then as now ‘Arctos and Orion
moved with opposed fronts '. No one has-expressed more
affectingly the beauty and the rarity of human sriendship.
It is not in nature to repeat the miracle of Pylades and
Orestes. No pagan has spoken more Christianly of the need
in human life of gentleness. The Ram is ill mated with
the Lion and the Centaur. No one of the poets of Stoicisrn
has heard more clearly the call of the universe to its
children, or felt more powerfully the homesickness os
humanity aspiring to a reunion with that which is divine.
‘Of heavenly origin‚' he say5‚ ‘is that mystery which is
ever calling us heavenward to the fellowship of all that is?
But with all this aspiration there goes the sense of defeat.
It is, perhapS, this unuttered sense of defeat breathing
through all Manilius’ poem which gives to it its deepest
quality. He comes before us like his own Engonasin—the
nameless sign that sinks beneath the weight of so'me over-
mastering toil unconjecturable.

Who set in heaven that sainting fire?
Who bowed thee with a pain unknown,

And bade above thee sound the Lyre
Beneath thee float the Virgin Crown Ρ,
