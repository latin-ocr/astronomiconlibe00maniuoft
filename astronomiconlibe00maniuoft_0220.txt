11 466-88 COMMENTARY

466. propriis. . . legibus: leges due to individual character, and
not arising out of the cognationes enumerated in 217-432.

469-70. conuersaque quaedam in semet : a condensed expression
by which Manilius means probably to indicate not merely that certain
signs se amant, but also that certain signs se uident and se audiunt.
His meaning would be more fully put by in se conuertuntur alia oculis,
alia auribus .· alia propriofauore ducuntur.

468. auribus: ablative‚ as iv. 751 uestibus haerent (which means
‘ belong to Aries in the matter of their garments ’).

471. idcirco: with quod 475 (there should be only a colon or
comma after 474) ; cf. 178, 180.

aduersis: contrariis ‘ non quidem sede et laco sed natura et lege ’‚
Du Fay, but wrongly and foolishly. The propriae leges (466) override
the leges set forth in 395—432‚ by which contraria are hostile.

472. sociata z i. e. et slgna quae inter se seriata sunt bellum contra
ἀλλήλους gerunt.

472-4. alienaque sede . . ., &c.: ‘and signs hostile by position
bring to birth men that are bound forever in sriendship, while men
born under the signs of the same triangle (triquetris orti) contend
with and shun one another!

Ι thought that Housman's correction of M's utrique trz'sorti had
only to be seen in order to be accepted. Yet Breiter does not so
much as notice it. aut odium soedusue gerunt, says Manilius (469),
of the individual stars propriis legibus. He goes on to say that these
priuata odia and fhedera override the relations imposed on the signs
sede, by their geometrical arrangement, διε. As a consequence even
aduersa are sometimes friends (47Ι); while signs of the same triangle
(or those born under such signs, which is the same thing), signs which
should be socz'ata‚ are often hostile. Could anything be inore
perspicuous or more certain?

triquetris: is not elsewhere used by Manilius as = trzgonis. But
see the lexicons, s. v. Similarly triangula signa occurs only at ii. 282.

476. uariantibus: predicative.

477. contulit, ⁴ brought together)

484. ‘Who derive their character from the stars that build their
nativity.' genus: not their ‘birth ', but their ‘sort ³, ‘kind’ ; naturas
suas, Du Fay.

artus in Du Fay's text is a mere misprint‚ but he comments:
Gemb. ortus : id est natim'tates .· quae lectio minus probatur!

485. consilium ipse suum est ε se amat says Breiter‚ forgetting
at once all his Latin and all his astrology. The words are merely
= se audit below. Aries takes advice from no one, he listens to
himself, ut principe dignum est. If Breiter did not know that no
sign se amat, he might at least have remembered that self-love is not
a very royal quality.

486-7. Taurus ‘plots deceit sor (hates) Aries3 and beyond Aries
beholds, through Aries’ stars‚ and hearkens to, the shining Fishes '.

ultra : = ultra Arietem, since Aries alone separates Taurus from
Pisces ; so, too, per sidera = per sidera Arietis.

488-9. Α glance at the accompanying figure, p. 111, will show (1) that
Taurus in fact sees not Pisces but Virgo; (2) that not Taurus, but
Sagittarius, loves Virgo (Virgine capitur). These two difficulties
have led to a number of emendations, none of which are worth
consideration. (uidet seems guaranteed by the epithet fulgentis;
emend away uidet, and you have fulgentis audit Pisces, ‘ hears the
