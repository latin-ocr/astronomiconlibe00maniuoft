ASTRONOMICON II

devise harm for the Archer. The Balance follows his own
counsel ; with his sight he encompasses only the Ram, and
with his heart the Scorpion below him. The Scorpion sees
the Fishes: and hates wholly the Balance. The Archer
has learnt to obey with his ears the mighty Lion, with his
eyes to behold the Urn of the Water-carrier3 and he loves,
os all the stars, only Erigone. Not so Capricorn : he turns
his gaze upon himself-what fairer or more awful sight could
he hope to gaze upon, seeing that it was he that shone happily
on the rising of Augustus? With his ears he assails the
prominences of the towering Crab. The naked Water-
carrier strains his ear to hear the Twins : he loves the huge
Crab and gazes at the drawn bow of the Archer. The
Fishes turn their eyes upon the fierce Scorpion, and are
fain to hearken to the Bull. These are the relations one
with another which nature established for the stars when
she founded them. And men one with another reflect the
dispositions of the stars whereof they are born. To some
they love to listen‚ others they love to look upon, and are
moved now by hate of these, now by love of those, sor some
spreading the nets of craft, themselves plotted against by
others.
’ F urthermore, triangles as such move in opposition one to
another. It is their alternate line that leads them to war
along opposed paths: and thus the system of truth is
harmonious in its every part. For the Ram, the Lion, and
the Archer, which are signs allied in one triangle‚ have no
peace with the Claws, and the whole triangle of the Claws—
the triangle which the Twins and the Water-carrier com-
plete. And that this is according to reason a twofold
consideration compels us to admit, for (1) in each triangle
three signs are diametrically opposed to three signs; and
(2) there still subsists in heaven the old war between men
and the beasts. The form of the Balance is human, that
of the Lion not human. And beasts yield to men because
wisdom is mightier than much strength. The Lion shines
among the stars because he was vanquished3 and it was
the loss of his golden fleece that gave to the Ram his place
among the signs. The Centaur himself, in so far as he has
the hinder parts of a horse, is inferior to man. Is there, then,
reason why 1 should marvel that men born under these
conquered signs can be vanquished by the triangle of the
