II 681—709 COMMENTARY

Jacob (followed again blindfold by Breiter), removing the comma
at subscribunt, takes proxima uicinis tertia quaeque as ‘signs
removed from one another by one sign, and which are therefore next
door to being neighbours '. Surely‚ again, ‘nicht ernst zu nehmen.'

Itis notable that in 385·90 Manilius says there is no consensus
between proxima, and in 572—6 that tertia are plerumque inimica.
But the inconsistency is not perhaps considerable ; a poet who believes
so little in true friendship is not likely to put much saith in the ties of
vicinitas and hospitium.

687. suas partes: logically inexact; Manilius means adde uni-
cuique szgrzo eas aliorum szjgrnorum parles quae proprio quodam iure
sibi uindz‘cat—‘ those parts that are their due ⁹, by the law of the dode-
catemorles.

Jacob takes partes as =sacli0ne53 and this is, he says, too
obvious to need mention! At 1ii. 33 Manilius describes the system of
dodecatemories by the phrase partes m pambus ipsis; and partes
here means precisyely ‘d'odecaternories‚ as is clear from sua partibus
astra, in which phrase astra = planetas and partibus- - dodecatemo-
morum dodecalssmorz’i (cf. 739 sqq.).

688. mixta: see n. on 749.

689. fines: Bentley's note and emendation (uires) are a character-
istic example of his petulant laziness. The fines are the fines of the
dadecutemm‘a, as 699 his finibus esse dodecalemorimn constat.

astris = planetis, as astra, 687 ; yet Breiter would have it that the
planets ‘ gehoren nicht hierher '.

692. 1 have preferred Bentley’s dignoscere to Pingre’s discernere
(which Breiterreceiv‚es) (1)as perhapsexplainingposczsofLM, (2)owing
to the doubtful Latinity of discernere with simple abl. Jacob’ s defence
of past-ducere is nugatory. [At Verg. Gemg. i. 351 for dzscere the
Medicean offers noscere. ]

693— 721. What a dodecatemory is. Every sign has 30 degrees or
parts. These are divided by 12, and ΒΩ -- 21· , a dodecatemory con-
sists of 21 degrees of a sign. Thus every sign has in it 12 dodecate-
mories, and distributes these among the other signs of the Zodiac m
this way: its first dodecatemory‚ its first.. '‘ss parts, it keeps for itself;
the second it gives to the sign that follows it, the third to the sign
that follows that, and so on through the twelve signs. This
mixtura accounts for the fact that the same sign produces diverse
characters.

693. ‘Co on to know a secret great in use but small in show’

Creech .

( 695. ‹iodecatemoriae duodecatenmria, MSS. here, and constantly.
But 1 think it certain that Manilius used the Greek form. Even in
De Ave Phoenice 28, where editors keep dvodecies (so Seneca Η. O.
109 5 has quatvor), Ι would prefer to write dodecz'es.

700. bis senaque cuncta : tama for cuncta, Housman-apparently
not perceiving that bis sena is different frorn duodecim.

708 sqq.: very similarly iv. 373-9.

709. errant humana: the reading of M and L clearly points us to
errant not e7¹rat3 and on this and on M's matura (= mat'a) I have
based the conjecture in the text (mata = umana). Something like this
the sense requires, and the Manilian love of antithesis comes out in
pecudes-human, z marem -fimzna, Cf. Lucr. iii. 760—1, Man. iv. 101- 2
