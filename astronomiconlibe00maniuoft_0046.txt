OTHER MSS. AND AN ATTEMPTED
CLASSIFICATION

‘Sed ante omnes is scriptor qui nunc Manilius perhibetur iratis librariis
natus est.'—BENTL13Y, Letter to P. Burmann.

I will speak first of four lost MSS.

1. Codex Politiam'. A certain Pietro Leoni, a professor os
medicine in Padua,¹ showed to Politian in 1491 a MS. of Manilius
whnssijPohffian pronounces ‘as oh} as any codex he had ever
seen '. Politian carried this off (one hopes with Leoni's leave, but
the morals of Renaissance scholars in such matters were lax) to
Venice, where he collated it with a printed text, which must
have been one of six texts—Regioniontanus‚ ed. Bononiensis, the
two Naples editions, Bonincontrius, Dulcinius.² Somewhere in
one of the libraries of Europe there still perhaps lies, awaiting
discovery, the copy (of one of these six texts) in which Politian
made his collation. The finding of this volume would be an
event of incalculable importance for Manilian criticism. For
Sabbadini, who has studied with great care the language which
Politian uses in describing other MSS.‚³ speaks of the date of the
Paduan codex thus: ‘Se di Manilio dice “che io per me non ne
viddi pili antiqui '', bisognera credere che fosse in maiuscolo o
communque anteriore al sec. ix.⁷4

It is tempting to identify this MS. with the codex (I will call it
a) of which I have already spoken as ⁴ lying behind our archetype '
—the source of the true readings peculiar to G. α can scarcely
have been later, and from its excellent readings may well have

¹ It was at Padua that Politian saw this MS„ not at Mantua, as Mr. Clark
says, by an error, in C. R„ xx, p. 227.

2 The Venice edition did not appear until after Politian’s death.

³ According to Sabbadini, Scoperte, pp. 169-70, ‘uetustissimus ', in
Politian’s usage, is an epithet reserved for MSS. prior to saec. ix.

⁴ Le Scoperle dei Codicz' Latini e Greci ne* secoli XIV e XV, p. 170. On the
whole subject cf. ib.7 pp. 154—5, 169—70.
