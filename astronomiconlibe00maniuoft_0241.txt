COMMENTARY 709—22

Gestirn wird ein Weib geboren²‚ Breiter‚ which is roughly correct.
The Latin means ⁴(under one and the same sign) a woman follows
upon a man ’, i. e. there is born first a man and then a woman.

Stoeber‚ and others, misunderstand the passage. Saepe eliam
monstrosos partus et androgynos fizcit, Stoeber, comparing—to prove
the genuineness of 709—1o—iv. 101 sqq„ which Bentley had cited to
prove their spuriousness.

710. sidere: Breiter retains the MSS. sidera, but he does not
translate it and I cannot.

713. quot: here and at i. 4, 508, 509, iii. 70, 275, 390, &c., &c., the
preponderance of MS. evidence seems to point to quod as the form
present in our archetype3 and Mr. Housman actually here prints
quod (= quot). quodannis for quolannis similarly is frequent in MSS.
and Inscriptions. (But quot for quod in Inscriptions is as frequent as
the converse ; cf. aliquit, aliut, set, ἃς.) If Mr. Housman thinks that
Manilius himself wrote quod for quot 1 can only say quod honn'nes lod
sententiae. Ι see not much more reason for printing quod at 713 than
for printing ad qaa at 929 or adque at 936.

716. subeuntibus: i.q. sequentibus.

720—1. summa repletur, &o : attuleras absolm'tur expletis triginta
partibus in omni sidere, Du Fay3 and to much the same effect
Pingre.

N o; sidere in omm' is in contrast to in sidere qzcoque3 the con-
struction is samma repletur (the total is made up to 30) exactis eis xxx
partibus quae in ceteris omnibus sunt sideribus.

722—37. Another method of finding the dodecatemory of a given
si n.

g The genius of Bentley in the correction of a desperate text is
nowhere more clearly seen than in his treatment of this perplexecl
passage. He is the first editor to understand it; and, stranger still,
the last. Scaliger, it is true, claims to have restored the passage
egregie. Nowhere is he louder in his own praise. Nos ipsimet in
Olympico stadio nos us'clores praedicabimus, he says. Yet, save for
the valuable correction quacumque in parti at 726, his much vaunted
restoration, and with it his interpretation of the whole passage, is
worthless. Huet justly points out that of the two rules which he makes
Manilius lay down the first has no ‘tail’ and the second no ‘ head.‘
Yet Huet's own interpretation is as useless as Scaliger's. Du Fay,
taking a hint from Scaliger, supplies after 729—in the shape of
a signum lacunae—the ‘tail ' which was wanting to the first of the
two rules. But he fails, though he shows some ingenuity, to find
a ‘head’ for the second. Nothing could in fact be done for this
passage so long as in 731 the impossible pariter sententia was left
standing. Bentley (following Regiomontanus—see critical notes) with
complete certainty corrected parilerwue) sententia to pariterque
seqzce7ztia3 and no subsequent editor-save only Bechert, and in the
English-edited Ceipics, a work dedicated ‘ to the manes of Bentley '—
has had the hardihood to cast a doubt upon this correction. Bentley
corrected pariler sententia. He also penetrated the meaning of
729—30‚ though his emendation of 730 is uncertain. (See note there.)
And finally he triumphantly expelled from the text 732—4: Hi uersus
et inepti siml et barbari etfalsi. He pointed out that there were
three rules excogitated by the ancient astrologers for finding the
dodecatemory of a given sign. The first is the rather cumbrous
method expounded in 715—21. The second is as follows: Take in
