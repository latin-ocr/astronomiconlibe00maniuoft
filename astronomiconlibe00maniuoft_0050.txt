INTRODUCTION II

The two collations sometimes disagree in small points, and
Auct. S. 5. 29 is clearly rather carelessly made.

Bentley's Preface‚ as Ι have noticed‚ says that Bentley found
the collation which he used of the Pithoeanus in a copy of the
editio Bononiensis. I have shown that this statement rests upon
a confusion. Bentley was in Oxford when the library of Isaac
Voss was offered for sale to the Bodleian.¹ He exerted himself
unsuccessfully to secure its purchase. But Vossius' copy of the
ed. Bonon., with Vossius' collation of the ‘ young Gemblacensis',
clearly passed to Bodley. It must, Ι think, have been purchased
by Bernard in 1689, when Vossius died. Bernard was an in-
defatigable collector of rare books and MSS„ particularly astro-
nomical MSS„ and on his death in 1696 a large part of his library
was purchased by the Bodleian. Linc. D. 5. [3 undoubtedly
belonged to him. He possessed also the MS. of Manilius which
is now in the Bodleian 3² and it is the natural inference from
Bentley⁷s Letter that he also owned the copy of ed. Bononiensis
which Bentley mentions in conjunction with Pithou's book and
the Bodleian Codex.

Bechert's reference to this MS. (Leipz. stud„ 1878, pp. 1 sqq.) I
do not understand. But he is clearly in error when he says that
the Vossianus mentioned in Bentley, Praef. xiv, is Voss. tertius.
It is our old friend V Δ Ι am not sure, again, of the meaning of
the paragraph in Jacob's Praefatio, xiv (to which Bechert refers
without comment), in which Jacob speaks of Spanheim's collation.
Jacob has here, Ι fancy, made the same mistake as Ellis—con-
fusing a collation of V ³ with one of V1. The MSS. which
Spanheim collated in Voss' house at Windsor in 1679 will thus
be V ² and Vss.

In what I have here said of Bentley's use of Pithoeanus and
ΙΝ, Ι had originally nothing but conjecture to rely upon. But
the inference to which I was led by a rather tedious process
of investigation, I have since been unexpectedly enabled to con-
firm in every particular. The Library of Trinity College‚ Cam-
bridge, contains a copy (B. 17. 29> of Scaliger's second edition
(1600) presented by Scaliger to Clusius. On the fly-leaf, in
Scaliger's unmistakable hand, is written ‘Clariss0 uiro Carolo
Clusio Ios. Scaliger D.D.' This book became subsequently part
