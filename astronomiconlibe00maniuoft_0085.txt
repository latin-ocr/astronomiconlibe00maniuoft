MANILIUS AND HIS EDITORS

the ‘ patronus-cliens Lucani '‚ Bonincontrius understood the astro-
logy of Holywood,¹ but not that of Manilius. How idle it is to
attempt thus to interpret the Rome of Augustus by the Oxford
and Paris of the thirteenth century no one needs to be told who
has read Scaliger, and, as an exposition of the meaning os
Manilius, Bonincontrius’ work is an idle undertaking. Yet it is
a work to which, on other grounds, some merits may be freely
allowed. I will specify here three merits: (1) the Commentary
is informed by a certain humanity—even in its superstition ; (2) it
contains a large number of illustrations of Manilius' language
drawn from other poets—notably Ovid, of whom Bonincontrius
has a good knowledge 3 (3) it contains not a few ingenious (and
one or two true) emendations.

Ι should add that the Codex Casst‘nenst‘s which Bonincontrius
professes to have employed (in which the poem was ascribed to
‘C. Manilius ⁵²) perhaps never existed. If it did it was perhaps
Cod. Vat. 3099 (72²). At any rate, no other extant MS. adds, as
does r2 (and as, according to Bonincontrius, did Cassinensis), the
words ‘ poetae illustris' after Manilius⁷ name. Ι would call atten-
-tion also to the fact that Cardinal Riario, to whom the Com mentary
is dedicated, was Abbot of Monte Cassino.³

Five years after Bonincontrius came the text of Dulcinius
(Milan, 1489). Dulcinius brought to the revision of the text one
new MS, and Cramer finds in his edition about 150 new readings
I have consulted this text with some care, and traced to it not a
few true corrections. This editor and Bonincontrius (who deeply
influenced him) alone of Manilian students prior to Scaliger show
any vigour and independence of mind.⁴

¹ Scaliger, opuscula Varia, Paris, 1610, pp. 362, 370; cf. Scah'geriana
(1658), p. 214 ‘ Manilium nullus suit qui possit intelligere sicut ego: non enirn
describit Astronomiam hodiernam sed ueterem· ; and Opusc. Van, p. 519.

2 Not L. Manilius, as Sabbadini, stud. Ital. dt'Pln'l. Class. ii, p. 110.

3 Ι take the opportunity here os correcting an error in Cramer <Die
ci'ltesten Ansgaben von Manilius* ‘A stronomica ’‚ 1893) ; 1. 38-9 are printed and
not, as Cramer says, written in the text. On the other hand 1. 16—17 are
written ; and it is clear from the arrangement os the type that they had been
altogether omitted, no space being left. Cramer’s doubt, p. 11, about
imaginibus is resolved by the Bodleian copy, which has z'maginib', without
trace os any erasure.

⁴ In his Praefatio, p. 5, Dulcinius characterizes the style of Manilius
justly: ‘ Elegans omnino est: et, quantum Hypothesis patitur, in uerbis et
sententiis figuratus, et ad Heroici poematis sublimitatem persaepe assurgens}
