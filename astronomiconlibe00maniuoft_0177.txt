COMMENTARY 45-8

P. L. M. iii. 103-4‚ perhaps contain a reference to Macer (1—4‚ 11-12),
and his poems were probably still extant in the time of Charlemagne.
Manilius possibly refers here also to Valgius 3 cf. Pliny N. H. xXV. 2 ;
Quint. x. 1. 56. Bonincontrius and Huet‚ however, are perhaps right
in supposing that Manilius is speaking rather os the Greek models of
these poets‚ e. g. N icander—(43 T beriam, 44 ophiaca : sor ophiaca see
Schneider, pp. 37—42‚ who collects the fragments) whom Quint. l. c.
mentions as the model of Macer and Valgius (Vergilius codd.).

46-8. Who the necromantic poets here referred to are it is impossible
to say. The only Latin work upon necromancy known to us before
Manilius' time is that of Appius Claudius—no doubt a prose work—
apparently dedicated to Cicero τ see ad Eun. iii. 4. 1 ; cf. T usc. Disp.
i. 16. 37 ; de Dz'v. i. 58. 132. The references, however, in Verg. Ecl.
viii. 95—100 alibi to the necromantic practices of Moeris are perhaps to
be interpreted as referring to the necromantic poetry of some poet of
the day. The Vergilian Moeris occurs in connexion with Pontus ; and
the part which herbae, in this eclogue and elsewhere, play in necro-
mancy makes it possible that the reference is to Aemilius Macer. The
other Macer, the friend of Ovid to whom Pontica ii. 10 is addressed, is
connected with Pontus, and the two poets may have been related
(a suggestion which Ι find is already made by Scaliger Thesaurus
p. 171 (1658) ). The strong attraction which necromancy had sor the
Romans under the early Empire is very clearly reflected in the poetica!
literature of the period. See e. g. Tibull. i. 2. 45 ; Verg. Aen. iv. 49ο;
Ecl. viii ; Hor. Sat. i. 8. 29 ; Epora ν. 29 sqq. ; Ovid silet. vii. 192 sqq. ;
Aetna 75 3 Lucan vi. 7333 Sil. It. viii. 98 sqq. ; Val. Fl. i. 730 sqq. ;
. Seneca Epigr. 16 (Baehr Ρ. L. M. ἰν. 60) ; and the Thebaid of Statius

and the plays of Seneca passim (as, leeb. iv. 418-645 ; Sen. O. T. 547).
Appius not only wrote upon, but himself practised, necromancy—uu·
solebat (Cic. Div. i. 58. 132). Vatinius practised it with various
magical adj uncts: Cic. in Vat. vi. 14 cum inaudita ac nefaria sacra susce-
peris5 cum inferorum animas elicere, cum puerorum extis deos manis
mactare soleas. A certain Junius (in connexion with the conspiracy of
Libo Drusus) is mentioned by Tacitus (Anu. ii. 28. 3) as temptatus ut
infernas umbras carminibus eliceret. Necrornancy is probably to be
understood among the infidas artes mentioned at 109-10-—quarum est
permissa facult(zs; and while speaking of necromancy among the
Romans, I will, for convenience, say here what Ι have to say of that
passage. Bentley's correction quarum haut permissa facultas is
demonstrably wrong. Facultas mm permissa sed legibus uetita est,
he says dogmatically. But if 1 ask quibus legibus? neither Bentley
nor any one else will name me any law at all directed against necro-
mancy as such. The locus classic-us upon the subject is Codex
Theodosianus ix. 6 with the Commentary of Gothofreclus‚ Leipsic‚ 1738,
iii, pp. 131 sqq.; cp. ix. 17. 1, 38. 3; xvi. 11. 12; Cocl. Justin. ix. 183
Novell. Valentia. iii. 23 (Mommsen and Meyer).¹ The Roman state
interfered with magical practices in general only when owing to them
either the state itself or its religion seemed in danger, or when the
person or property of individual citizens was attacked. Thus in 97 B. C.
a Senatus consullum dealt with human sacrifice—a frequent accom-
paniment of necromancy, as may be seen from Cic. in Vat. and Hor.
Epod. noticed above ; to which add, from a later period, the reference
in Justin Apol. i. 18 to ἐπόπτευσις by means of ‘pure ’ children, and in

¹ 1 owe these references to the kindness os Professor Paul Vinogradofl‘.
