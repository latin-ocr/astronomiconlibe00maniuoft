II 358—61 COMMENTARY

hexagonal association. Firmicus admits it: hexagona lenc idem sunt
quod trzgona nisi quod vn'naris potestatis (ii. 22) ; Bouche-Leclercq,
. 172.
p 358. quin dubia: so I have emended dubiaque of (5¹ and (lunaque
of M (which is the same). (For misunderstanding of quin by the
scribes see 19, 187, 197, 223. At i. 40 perhaps quin natura is the
true reading; at iv. 54 perhaps quin eliam possem at iv. 89 quin nec
paupertas. H ousman's quin placidum at iv. 28 5 is certainly correct.)
L's densaque (so G2) is a clumsy attempt to emend diuz'aque3 and
therefore Jacob’s debilia, based on it, has little value. Ι can attach no

meaning to deuia commem-im and -que is not possible as a connecting

praedales M, praedat Ven., per tales cett.)‚ ‘ missing out.'

limes: so all the MSS. limes is used by Manilius at i. 607 for
the line of the equinoctial colure3 and I see no reason, therefore, why
it should not be used here for the line of the Zodiacal Circle.

Breiter alters formantur to feriuntur—an improbable change in
itself; with Scaliger, he changes limes to limas—though ιι and e are
not commonly confused ; to limas he gives the sense of lineas, though
it can only mean ‘ files'. The plural limas is in itself wrongz-there
is, for Manilius, only one line, though it takes numerous angles;
