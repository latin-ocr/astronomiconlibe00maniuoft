INTRODUCTION II

Ven„ but a body of excerpts sufficiently large to enable us to
judge fairly of its character and of its position among the Manilian
MSS. These excerpts are indeed a ἕρμαιον of very considerable
interest. It is true that Ven„ as they now allow us to see it, is
a MS. which will not in any important passage alter the text of
Manilius. Bentley could hardly have failed to note in his edition
any of its readings which were at once new and true. On the
other hand, our best MS, Μ, was unknown to Bentley, and he
had necessarily no perception of the true relations subsisting
between the Belgian and Italian stocks. On those relations the
rediscovery of Ven. will be found, I think, to throw a good deal of
light. In my Apparatus Criticus Ι have cited all the readings of
this MS. which Bentley has recorded in Book II, save for a—not
inconsiderable-—number of places where the confused condition
os his notes (notes made for himself and not for others) made it
not possible to determine with certainty what reading Ven. really
offered. (In the narrow margins of a single volume Bentley has
crowded together the readings not only of nine MSS. but also
os several editions—to say nothing of his own conjectures.)
1 hope in another place to print all the readings of Ven. for
Books Ι and III—V. Here I shall call attention only to what
Iregard as salient lections. But they will, I think, sufficiently
reveal the character of this MS. After GLM it is, I have no
doubt, the most important of our Codices.

It represents, as I have said, the un-italicized Belgian tradition.
So in the main does C: so in a less degree does Asara But the
importance of Ven. consists in the fact that, unlike C and Marc„
it is independent of GL. While it agrees in the main with GL
against M, yet it sometimes agrees with Magainst GL, sometimes
with LM against G, sometimes with G against LM. Unless we
are to suppose with Breiter that Gronovius (who was very unlikely
to do so) mistook a fifteenth-century MS. for one of sace. xi, and
that the M readings have come into Ven. actually from lis, then
we can only explain our facts by deriving Ven. from some MS. of
the GL type which occasionally preserved more faithfully than
GL the reading of the archetype. I had perhaps, therefore,
better begin by saying why I think it impossible to assign Ven. to
the fifteenth century.

(1) Despite its occasional agreements with M it represents the
GL tradition in a manner so distinctive as to make it unlike any
