MANILIUS AND HIS EDITORS

annotationis past. We have entered the epoch of serious, sus-
tained and laborious commentation. Emendation, again, which
with the Italians was a learned toy, becomes with Scaliger an
occupatiori true to the meaning of the word. It becomes a sober
study directed to removing from the texts of antiquity the faults
which they have contracted in their transmission. But, above all,
Scaliger's Manilius is important as a part of his lifelong effort to
unify our knowledge of antiquity. Students of Manilius need
perhaps to be reminded that this work was merely a preparation
for a greater work. It was merely a prelude to the Emendatio
Temporzcm. And what is most marvellous about it, as about the
Emendatio, is its horizon. For contemporary scholars Roman, or
at best Greek and Roman, antiquity constituted their moenia
mundi. Scaliger passes these narrow bounds, and is the first
scholar to try and see antiquity as a whole and all history and
literature as a single order.l And already in the Manilius one is
sensible of this infinite range. No previous work of scholarship
offers any parallel to it, and perhaps no succeeding work. Bentley
and Lachmann are great names in Latin scholarship‚ but when
one sets this single work of Scaliger in its true historical perspec-
tive the whole sum of their achievement appears in comparison
something thin and unreal.2 Beside Scaliger they seem but blood-
less ghosts. οἶος πέπνυται” τοὶ δὲ σκιαὶ ἀΐσσουσι.

It would be interesting to speculate how sar the peculiar direction taken by
Scaliger’s scholarship was determined by his anti-Catholic prejudice.

³ When he first took Manilius in hand 1 cannot discover. His Calalecla
appeared in 1573. And from Ep. iii-iv, de Larroque, it is clear that he was
already then deep in Manilius. Yet between 1573 and 1577 he published
editions os Ausonius, Festus, Catullus. Tibullus, Propertius; and in July,
1577, he writes to du Puy (de Larroque⁷ Ep. xvii, p. 68) that he should

Ptolemy's Telrabiblos. He has only been able to read the work ‘tourne
