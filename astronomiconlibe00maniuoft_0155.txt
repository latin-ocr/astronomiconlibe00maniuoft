ASTRONOMICON II

The moon will be in the dodecatemory of that signin which
you get a remainder less than thirty. Pursuing this method
you will find that the moon will control each of the other
dodecatemories according to the fixed order in which the
signs are arranged.

That the theory of the dodecatemories may lead you into
no error, learn now in brief what it is that is called the
dodecatemory of a dodecatemory. The dodecatemory is
divided into five parts. For five planets shine pre-eminent
in the heavens ε and each planet controls a half-degree, and
in it exercises sway and influence. We must note, there-
fore, in what dodecatemory the planets are at any moment
stationed. For, in any given sign, a planet will work
powerful results on the influence of the particular dode-
catemory into whose province it has come. We must take
into account this all-pervading interaction : for upon it
everything depends. But all these things in their entirety
I will expound anon in due order. For the present it suffices
to put before you clearly each new fact according as it is
needed. Thus when you have mastered the individual
parts of my theme and stand firm in your saith, you will be
able by an unlaborious process of reasoning to trace out

’ for yourselfthe whole body of it ; and my poem after having

treated of particulars will fitly pass to speak of the whole
which they form. In giving children their first lessons‚ you
teach them to begin with the appearance and forms of
letters before putting before them the use of them: then
you form a syllable of letters duly linked together: then
comes the building of words to be duly bound together
through their parts. Then you teach the child meanings
and instruct him in the art of words, and finally, with
measured pace, a poem rises and comesto live. And in the
business of the perfect work it profits to have mastered
each step that went before ; whereas, unless these steps
are firmly founded in a mastery of elements‚ Ambition’s
bold design will dissolve, and the wisdom too hurriedly
taught will suffer overthrow. Even so I, passing swiftly in
song up and down the universe and drawing out the Fates
from their deep and dark retirement, setting thern to
