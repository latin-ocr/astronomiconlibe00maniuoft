ΙΙ 130—142 COMMENTARY

experientia—occurs at Statius Tlceb. ii. 289 prima fides operi3 and
might perhaps have compared Aetna 223 nosse fidem rebus. The play
fides . . . fides is just Manilz’anae argutiae once more. (Ellis takes
fides as = ἀξιοπιστία naturae, somewhat differently.) zsssa fides saciet
operi probationem. pondus, efficaciam. fidem, experimenta, Bonincon-
trius.

131. nam neque decipitur ratio: ratio is the ὀρθὸς λόγος of the
Middle Stoa, the infallible ‘criterion ’ by which Panaetius and
Posidonius replaced the naively materialistic ‘aconitaque’ of the earlier
Stoics; Schmekel Die philosophie der mz‘ttleren Stoa, 1892, p. 354
foll.

132. sequenda: this (Du F ay ?) and not secunda (Bentley from the
Edd. uett.) is the true correction of the MSS. secunda. Non la‘c
loquitur Manilius de noua uia inquirenda astronomiae: sed docet
astronomiam sequendam esse quippe quae a ueris causis ducta fidem
sibi ideo conciliet, Ellis, aptly.

ueris accredita causis: so I have written for the MSS. ac ueris
credita, which Breiter against all reason retains (cs. Aetna 44 5-6
spectataque ueris occurrit szgnis). 1f this alteration is thought too
violent, we should read with Ellis a ueris.

1 34- 5. Cf. Verg. Georg. i. 463-4 solem quis dicere salsum audeat?

135. uincere: i. q. reuincere‚ refellere.

136. cum ad sidera: Manilius rarely elides a monosyllable, and
when he does so it is always either, as here, before a monosyllable, or
before a word the first syllable of which is a monosyllabic preposition
(as iii. 194 at cum obducta), except sor four examples, i. 287 sed cum
aer, iv. 547 cum autumnales, and twice before onmia (ii. 749, i. 770).
In all four examples the syllable elided is not long but mediate. Many
alleged examples are false: as ii. 171, 924, where see notes; iii. 343
uide Breiter3 iv. 53, where I believe we should write quin etiam and
bracket the whole line.

On the subJect of elision of long syllables generally in Manilius see
note on 747. Ι think that no one who reads this note and that one
will find it easy to persuade himself that so fastidious a metrist, or
rhythmist‚ as Manilius was the stammering African—or Asiatic or
Gaul—that some critics have seen in him.

138. in orbe: not in orbe terrarum (as per orbem, 144), nor in orbe
szjgnzfero3 but any circular course, a chariot course.

139. liber agam currus: so Bentley, for the ubera tam currus of
JlIL1. The umbrato curru of ΟΕ, though accepted by Gronovius
(arcuato et clauso, Gronovius) is clearly here inapposite3 and the
same is true of Breiter’s librato curru. Manilius’ chariot is not, as
Breiter’s note suggests, one of the heavenly bodies, nor (see on 128)
travelling through heaven. Moreover, without some verb in the indic.
mood between condam (137) and canam (141) the balance of the sen.-
tence is, as Bentley observes, completely destroyed. Cf. Lucr. vi. 47
inszgnem conscendere currum, &o ; Nemes. Cyn. ix. iuuat aurato pro-
cedere curru (all Nemesianus' Prologue owes something to Manilius).

141. mirantibus: rex(ress L¹)antibus ML¹ is unexplained. For
Ellis' rixantibus we might perhaps compare Pliny Ν. Η. ii. 43. 113
(the air from the earth, depressed by the stars) nube collibitum tonare,
natura strangulante sonitum dum rixetur, edito fragore cum erumpat '-
But the nature of this heavenly rixa is there clear enough.

142. uel (canam eis mirantibus hominibus) quibus illa (astra) non
inuidere sacros meatus et notitiam sui (= notitiam suorum sacrorum-

78.
