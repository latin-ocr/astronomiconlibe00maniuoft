COMMENTARY 261—74

the form of the line cf. Prop. iv. 7. 69 sic mortis lacrimis uitae
sanamus amores.

265—9. Stjgna (1) Verna: Aries, Taurus, Gemini; (2) Aestiua:
Cancer, Leo, Virgo3 (3) Autumnalia: Libra, Scorpion, Sagittarius ;
(4) Hiberna: Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces.

268. scribuntur in : i. q. censentur and abl„ assignantur. fortasse
tribuuntur, says Scaliger ; but see 459 in Geminos (so Bentley, rightly)
aequali bracchia sorte scribuntur.

terna : (terrae MSS.) : not Bentley’s correction (as Ellis, Brester),
for it appears already in Du Fay. (Similarly at 295 ternaque dett.‚
Regiom., terraque codd.) Jacob retains terrae as dal. commodi. Ellis
joins terrae with scribuntur.

269. autumnis: adjective; autumni, Housman, forgetting 425
autumno tempore 3 Columella xi. 3. 38 autumno semine. Cf. Gronovius
Observationes ii. 5, p. 109.

270-432. In 150—269 Manilius has been concerned with the Zodiacal
signs as individual constellations. He now passes to their combinations
—consensus‚ foedera (271). These combinations are arranged on
geometrical principles. The first principle is the triangular one
(270-87‚ 297—375)‚ the second the quadrangular (287—96‚ 297—3 57, the
third the liexagonal (358-84)‚ the fourth the diametric (391—432).

The ‘schematism’ of the Zodiacal signs, sometimes called the
theory of ‘aspects’, was the most elaborate achievement of Greek
astrology (neither Egyptian nor Chaldean remains suggest a non-
Greek origin for it), and the basis of all astrological science. The
name ‘aspects ’ (ὄψεις, aspectus), which is often substituted for σχήματα,
is popular rather than scientific, illustrating the constant tendency to
‘humanise' astrology. Signs communicating by the line of triangle‚
quadrangle, &c., are said to behold one another. See Censorinus
l). N. viii. 3-13 (who uses conspectus).

270. nec satis est . . . noscere: the phrase recurs at iii. 581,
iv. 409. For the infinitive after the adverb satis cf. ii. 331, 751, 966;
so aster parum, i. 163 after ninas, iii. 34, iv. 439 (Cramer Der
Infim‘tiv bei M, p. 68).

proprias . . .formas: ‘their configuration as isolated signs'.
The propria forma is distinguished from the geometrical σχηματισμός.
Hence Bentley's sortes sorsormas is unnecessary, and, owing to sorte
in 272, unlikely. 155—96, 244—64 all describe (and not merely 256-64,
as Ellis, q. v.) the propriae formae of the signs.

272. sorte locoque: ‘ according to what is ordained for them, and
to their position in the Zodiacal circle'3 or, possibly‚their interrelation
viewed ζωδιακῶς (loco) and μοιρικῶς (sorte) ; cf. 297 sqq.

273. circulus extremo signorum ut clauditur orbe: so Ι have
endeavoured to correct the MSS. circulus ut dextro szgrn. claud. orbe.
extremo = extreo became dextro (owing perhaps to the influence of
the lemma in M, qnae eorum (lextra aut sinistra), and ul was then
transposed metri gratia.

dextro Bentley rightly pronounees impossible; nor, were it not
so, would Stoeber‚ as he does, defend it. My extremo is palaeo-
graphically and, 1 think, in sense superior to Bentley’s flexo. Com-
pare with it iv. 361—2 orbe feruntur extremo3 Anth. Lat. Riese ii.
761. 16 Piscibus extremus locus est quem szgm‘fi’r explet.

· l ut: possibly ‘where’‚ as Catull. xi. 33 but ‘when' may be
rig it.

274. discurrit: the line runs out; you have not got to draw it; it
