COMMENTARY 533—6

533. ferae partis: Stoeber and Ellis defend the MSS. suae partis,
interpreting tergore suae partis as tergus equinum quod partem eius
constituit. I have followed Bentley (and Breiter) in reading serae
(=f'ae) for suae (=suae). The older correction suae parti (so also
Postgate, Housman) is a smaller change, but does not, Ι think, give
the sense required. ‘Centaur yields with his equine parts (tergore)
to his human parts (suae φανῶ] Perhaps true; but Manilius, as
I understand him, is trying to say that Centaur, like Aries and Leo, is
a beast who, before he came to heaven, was conquered on earth by
a man.

534—5. The construction is: usque adeo est quod mirer homines ab
illis uictis (pecudibus) nascentes superari posse Librae tmgono ,9 ‘is
there any great reason why Ι should be surprised at men born under
these vanquished cattle being conquerable by Libra’s triangle.’

The use of quod is the same as that at Hor. Ep. ii. 1. 30 non est
quod multa loquantum Verg. Aen. xii. 11 nihil est quod dicta
retractent3 Cic. Dz‘v. ln Caec. ξ 2 5 nz'lzz'l erit . . . quod arbitretur.
On this use of quod see Munro, Lucr. i. 82.

In the text as given I have changed only two letters of the MSS„
correcting ‘ hominis uictus' to ‘ homines uictis ’.

bominis uictus is commonly corrected to lzovn'm' uictus, followed
by a full stop, the subject of uictus being Centaurus. (This involves,
1 think, serae partis in 533.) For the dat. homini uictus Postgate
compares i. 759, iv. 896, which surely furnish no parallel. The older
correction, lzominz's uirtus, is, perhaps, Latin, but it could only mean
‘to such an extent is Centaurus the virtue of a man '.

The MSS. vary between quod mirer and quo mirer. Scaliger
took quo mirer as =‘wherefore (and so) I should marvel'3 and
though Bentley has pointed out that this is not Latin, Breiter thinks
it is and prints it. Scaliger and Breiter with quo in 534 read
nascentis . . . lrzgonum in 535. nascentis Breiter renders by ‘der
aufgehenden Wage ', as iv. 516 nascentis Tauri3 but why should the
whole triangle of Libra be more powerful when Libra, singly, is rising
than under other conditions? nascentis is clearly accus. plur„ and
this necessitates tragono. Postgate with trzgono reads quid mirer,
but this is patently awkward in its abruptness, though a colon merely
after uictus removes some of this abruptness ; usque adeo, ‘ seeing he
is thus . . . why then should Ι marvel.’

536. 1 have enclosed this line in brackets, and 1 have little doubt
that either it is spurious or it has been seriously misplaced. For
(1) what can breuior ratio mean, following on 520-3 5 ? It can only mean
a ratio which is breuior than that of 520-35. But the ratio of 520—3 5
is the ratio of triangular opposition53 yet so is the breuior ratio, as
appears from 541—693 see note on 541. (2) How comes it that the
breuior ratio occupies more space than the (longior) ratio of 520—3 5 ?
(3) At 570, dismissing the breuior ratio, Manilius says of it that it is
not the sola ratio, but there is also the ratio (to which he then passes)
of the opposition of tertia, But, of course, it is not the sola ratio, if it
has been preceded by the ratio of 520-35. If Manilius gives us one
ratio at 520—35, another at 536—69, he cannot possibly at 570 say nec
sola est ratio—when he means that there is yet a third ratio. (4) A
careful analysis of 531-—8 will show that 536 entirely interrupts the train
of reasoning‚ thus: 5 31—3 the ferina signa were conquered by men
before they came to heaven; 534—5, is it then surprising that those
born under signs that have been conquered (on earth) should prove
