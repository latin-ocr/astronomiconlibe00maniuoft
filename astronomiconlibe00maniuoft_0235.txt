COMMENTARY 599-620

of villains skulk behind the name of friend' (Creech). sic J. Caesar
ab amicis occisus est, Du Fay. Haud dubie grassantes ln'umm'ros
z'ntellzssgit, Jacob. Other editors are careful to conceal their ignorance.
Ι can nowhere find that any one has explained the line. The reference
is to the sodalitia, and perhaps supplies us with a new date in the life
of Manilius. The Lex Licinia of 55 B.C., which dealt with the dis-
orders arising from the sodalitia, seems to have been superseded by
the Leges Iuliae de A mbitu (Mommsen De Colleg. et Sodalz'liis, 1843,
pp. 72 sqq). The first of these Leges Iuliae was passed in 18 Β. c.‚
the second ten years later. Our present passage may very well have
been written while the circumstances which gave rise to the law of
8 B. C. were still fresh in men’s minds. [In that case, the conclusion
of Book Ι will be os later date: see Introduction, p. lxi sqq.] Under
Tiberius when, as Tacitus says, the comitia passed from the Campus
to the Senate, the sodalitia would have ceased to furnish a typical
illustration of political violence.

601—2. legesque per ipsas saeuit nequities: not ‘crime makes
havoc among the laws', but ‘iniquity rages employing as its instru-
ments the very laws themselves’3 cf. Seneca Prov. iii. 7 post fidem
immo per ipsam fidem trucidata.

poenas iam noxia uincit: scelus superat iam supplicia,
Du Fay; ‘les forfaits sont enfin devenus plus grands que les suppliceS‚'
Pingre—just as Stat. Theb. i. 56 angustaque Tartara paenis, hell is
not big enough for the crimes it has to punish. [One would expect
uicit3 and one might take uincit as from uincire (Iniquity works now
by process of law (leges per ipsas) and commits Punishrnent to
prison) save for umcant. poenas, Claudian Rus 1i. 519. ]

605. fidei: the same genitive at 630, 955· to the examples cited by
Neue· -Wagner i. 573 add Stat. Theb. vii. 5423 Sen. Thyest. 764.
Lucret. v. 102 hasfidez‘, following Ennius Α1111. 342 (plenu’ fidez); but
nowhere( else m Latin poetry (outside Plautus) do we find anything but
fldet‘ or (.e g. Ovid Met. iii. 341,vi. 506) fide. At 1ii. 107 fideique tenet
parentat uera the sormfidez, dative (found also' m Seneca lhyest. 520,
cf. spei, dative, Phaedra 131), is false-as false as the form aquai
(dative) which Brieger and Bailey have introduced into the text of
Lucretius ati. 453. (See Lindsay, C. R. x. pp. 424—7. Lindsay might
have noted that at Lucr. i. 687, ii. 235 7ez' is rendered suspicions by

thle³ fact that it is preceded at i. 687 by praeterea, at ii. 235 by
su sistere.

606. ut ipsum sibi caelum sic {fisa sibi tellus dissidet; out of ipsa
tellus we must supply an ipsum for caelum, otherwise ipsa tellus
would imply a superiority of tellus over caelum.

607. sorte: ‘une fatalite imperieuse‚' Pingre, vaguely3 pari odio,
Du Fay, correctly if inexactly ; cf. 609 amica sorte feranmr.

608-42. The interrelations of the different signs of the same triangle ;
and the influence of these relations on man’ s destiny

608-9. The construction is: sz cupis dz'·77050e7e quae sz‘b ana cognata
(= trzgona) tangant ammos, Sec.

614. expositumque: just as we say ‘exposed to’ 3 as i. 357, 427
expositamwe) . . . undi53 but here in metaphor: a common post-
Augustan use.

suae noxae: not, as editors, ‘injury of himself’, but ‘injury
proper to him ’, proper to a mitius astrum molli ingenio et corpore.

618. gratia facti: Verg. Aen. iv. 539, vii. 232.

619—20. creatus: so 1 have written boldly for the trtjgono of MSS.
