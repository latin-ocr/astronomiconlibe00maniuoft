COMMENTARY 571—86

bene uelle 3 (2) in mutua uelle as = εἷς τὸ ἀλλήλους φιλεῖν is too Punic
even for Manilius. (The same objection ap lies to Postgate‘s nolle:
and can nolo te mean te non bene uolo ?) (3 Manilius is talking not
of mutual love but of mutual hate.

574-6. Manilius' meaning is admirably hit by Bentley ε sume quaeuss
signa contraria siue opposita, cancrum et capricornum .· tertia quaeque
a cancro, lzz'nc murm, illinc uirgo, sunt trigonum capricorni.
Similiter tertia quaeque a capricorno, pisces et scorpios, sunt cancri
trlgonum. Porro trigona cancri et capricorni aduersa inter se sunl, ut,
supra, uersu 520, arietis et librae.

tertia are opposed 3 for signs which are tertia to any sign belong
to the triangle of its contrarium.

574. quippe: so Housman for MSS. quoque (i.e. qp for qq). 1f
quoque is retained it will necessitate Bentley's illinc in 576.

577-8. ‘So that one need not be surprised at peace not existing
between stars that are connected with the signs of an opposed triangle ’ ;
e. g. one need not be surprised at Taurus and Virgo being opposed to
Cancer, for they are both cognata with the signs of Capricorn's triangle
-xvhich is aduersum to that of Cancer.

trigoni : a necessary correction of MSS. trigona.

579—607. A digression on the rarity of true friendship, and on the
many vices of human society.

The latter part of this passage owes something to the conclusion
of Catullus’ Peleus and Thetis. Both writers draw their feeling as
much frorn the contemplation of Roman society as from Greek legend.
The rarity of Fides is a common Stoic theme; cf. Seneca Tranq. An.
κν. 1, ed. Hermes, p. 272.

580. corpora, ‘men'; see on 544.

quotiens: 1 see no reason for altering to totiens (Bentley,

Breiter). The construction is quotiens inimica corpora creantur per
tot signorum species (quot dixi) et lot modis (quot dixi) surgunt, ‘as
often as men are born hostile to one another, they arise hostile owing
to just these configurations of signs (Ι have spoken of) and in just
these combinations.'
t 582. pectore amicitiae : a sensitive phrase in which the genius of
the ancients for friendship finds telling expression. Yet from here,
and from the other places in Latin poetry where it occurs (they are
collected by Ellis at Catullus lxxvi. 6), unfeeling commentators have
wished to expel it. Yet than phrase or thing m‘lzz‘l maius nec rarius.
The classical languages are forever thus surprising us with an un—
guessed romanticism.

583. unus erat Pylades: Ovid Pont. iii. 2. 65 (82) sqq.

58 5—6. I have enclosed both these lines in brackets; not that I have
any quarrel with 585, but because 586 seems to me indefensible and
unemendaffle, and it involves in its fate 585.

et duo qui potuere sequi is a pious additum of some one who
recalled Damon and Pythias. But the unus . . . unus of 583, the lis
una of 584 make it logically and rhetorically and poetically impossible
that Manilius should have gone on to speak of these two. And then
the Latin! duo what? nempe duo lites! or is it duo Pyladae? And
what is the object of sequi? uix noxia poenis again is modelled on
602 poenas iam noxia uincit; and is meant to mean ‘scarcely could
punishment find guilt to punish'—there was the penalty for sin but no
sinner. Barbare «lictum, as Bentley says ; and all attempts at debar-
barizing it have sailed. Vides quanto molimine Scaliger et Bentleius
