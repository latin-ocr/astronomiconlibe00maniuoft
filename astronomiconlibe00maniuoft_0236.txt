11 620-43 COMMENTARY

(cf. 627), otherwise retaining the text of the codd„ ‘those born under
either of these signs do not spare the offspring of Aries but inter-
mittently, as occasion demands, wage war against him!

For parcere in cf. Lucr. vi. 399 neque parcit in hostis.

621. Bentley, followed by Breiter, &c., athetizes this line. But it
seems more reasonable to suppose with Jacob that we have here
a genuine line in which pro tempore, accidentally repeated from the
preceding line, has displaced the concluding words. I have conjec-
turally replaced pro tempore by quam iniuria, but cogit also should
perhaps be altered (suadet would do).

623. quam te . . . sub uno: quam in te qui sub uno (i.e. simplici,
non bina, forma) es.

624. Should this line perhaps be transposed to follow 618? In its
present place it is intolerably flat.

626. magis ε sc. quam Leonis et Centauri et Arietis mentes;
coeunt ad f. m.: Verg. Aen. xi. 292 coeant in foedera dextrae3 Stat.
Theb. i. 470 coeant animorum in ngrnora dextrae.

629. The MSS. offer quosque dabunt Chelae et quos dat Aquarius
ortus; but since 631 is found in no MSS. (apparently the creation of
Bonincontrius), 629-—as it stands unmetrical—must have contained
a mention of Gemini. Yet Jacob's correction (based on Bentley's
quosque dabunt Gemini Chelaeque et A. ortus) is somewhat doubtful
—though I have printed it-since instead of -qzce (quosque) an adver-
ῗῖῒίνε particle is wanted. Perhaps set quos dant Clzelae Geminique et

. ortus.

635. actus : perhaps not ‘ behaviour ’ but ‘motion ’. The word would
be suitable to the quick motion of a fish or serpent, but hardly to the
more dignified deportment of the crab.

636. sub nomine: ‘ character’ 3 16 et sub fratre uiri nomen.

643-92. It is not sufficient to regard the signs as sels-contained and
sels-sufficient. The manner in which they distribute their degrees
(parts os themselves) among one another is important. Szgna quad-
rata, trzgona, contraria, tertia have their peculiar powers and functions ;
but the mundus takes the functions of one region and transfers it to
another. Quadrata preside over blood-relationship, trigona over
friendship3 neighbours are the care of uicina mgna, guests of tertia.
But you must over and above this give to each sign those parts of some
other sign which belong to it of right. You rnust allow, that is, for the
dodecatemories ; and what these are Ι will now explain.

Any one who takes up the only convenient text of the A stronomica
which exists——Breiter‘s—will find that Breiter has made the connexion
of ideas in this somewhat difficult passage hopelessly obscure by
making 686 end a paragraph. By so dividing the passage he has made
what is, logically, only a parenthesis (652-86) into the main theme of
643-86. No; the main theme from 643—749 is the dodecatemorie53
and the mention of the functions and powers of quadrata trzgona, &c.,
is only introduced preparatorily to explaining to the reader that these
powers and functions are deducted from by the dodecatemories.

See note on 649-50.

643. solis.. . signis: ‘in isolation'; but neither that rendering
nor the Latin saves Manilius from ambiguity. What he means is not
really cleared up till 688 nihil in totum seruit sihi. No star is suffi-
cient to itself ; it borrows degrees or parts from other stars and gives
degrees of its own in return. solis, therefore, is ‘ in isolation '‚ but not
‘in isolation ' as opposed to conjunction in quadrata or augona, the
