ASTRONOMICON II

Greatest of all poets is he that with inspired lips sang of
the death-struggle of the Ilian race, of Priam king and father
of fifty kings, of the warfare ten Summers long, and ofTroy
that fell with the fall of Hector; that sang the wanderings
of Ulysses, leader of mem—how, for years as many as those
wherewith he conquered Troy, he pursued yet another war,
and on the seas marshalled battle again, and in his native
land, storming his own roos-tree, fought a last fight. To
that poet the zeal of rival claimants has given many father-
lands-only to leave him none. Yet from his lips has all
after-time drawn for its song a stream of inspiration welling
up abundantly: and boldly parcelling the parent stream
into meagre rivulets has grown fertile from the richness of
a single soul. Next unto him is Hesiod,speakingto us of gods
and the parents of gods : of Chaos travailing with Earth: of
the heaven under chaos as yet inarticulate, what time the
stars stumbled as they essayed their first motions: of the
Titans old and of the cradling ofJupiter : of Jupiter that as
brother was husband and that was father to one whom no
mother bare: of Bacchus born a second time from the body
of his father: of all the lights that float and flash in the
wide sky. Moreover‚ he appointed for us the tilling of the

· fields and the laws thereos, and all our fight with the soil.

He it was that taught us how Bacchus loves the hillside‚
secund Ceres the meadow-land, Pallas hillside and meadow-
land alike: and he taught us how trees may be ignobly
mingled with fruits not their own. He told us of the
woodland deities and of streams hallowed by the presence
of nymphs: and established works for us in our quiet days
that we might attain to the mighty uses of nature.

And there are certain of the poets who have described
to us the diverse configuration of the stars‚ and have
assigned to their proper class and cause all the constella-
tions that glide at large in the spreading heaven. Perseus
and Andromeda, with the mourning mother and the father
speaking comfort,—these were taken to the stars by reason
of the punishment which Andromeda bore. Thither was the
daughter of Lycaon transferred by reason of her ravishment‚
Cynosura because of her tender care of Jupiter, Capella for
her milk, the Swan for love's disguise‚ Erigone for her
