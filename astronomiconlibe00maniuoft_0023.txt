THE THREE PRINCIPAL MSS.

and they are separated by eleven pages of 38 lines from IV. 313 ;
and at. IV. 313 there has occurred a very notable and extensive
transposition. In GL IV. 10-313 has become transposed with
111. 400-IV. 9. Now IV. 10-313 gives us 304 lines, that is exactly
six pages of 38 lines each. These six pages have been transposed
across 111. 400-IV. 9, a space of 292 lines. Instead of these
292 lines we should expect 304 lines; but the deficiency is to
be explained by the fact that III. 400-1V. 9 contain the transition
from Book III to Book IV: we may reasonably allow twelve
lines for subscriptio, titulus, and the capitula¹ to Book IV.
What happened in α then is quite plain. A whole ternio (of
38 lines to the page) was completely inverted in the process
of binding.

These facts about the MS. froni'which GL are descended
Icalled attention to casually in a sootnote in the C. Q„ ii. 2, p. 126.
I imagined that they must have been observed by any one who
had ever studied an Apparatus to Manilius. But Ι had not then
read Bechert's paper in Lezpzzgrer Studien, 1878. Judge my sur-

prise when 1 found that he tried to explain the phenomena which

‚ I have noticed in GL by the hypothesis of an archetype of 44 lines
to the folium—the archetype of GL and M. Thielscher in Philo-
logus, 1907, repeats in the main the arguments of Bechert. Yet,
apart from all arithmetical difficulties, it is unlikely that so late
a MS. as M would have escaped a confusion in the archetype
which has affected so strangely two eleventh-century MSS. But
the arithmetical difficulties are really insuperable. To get away
from them Thielscher is reduced to assuming that A contained
anything between 44-50 lines to the folium. But the very com-
plicated transpositions in Book I make it quite clear that the
number 44 was rigid ; and Ι hope to be able from the later books
to adduce many indications of this.

The foundation for a systematic study of the archetype of the
Manilian MSS. was laid by Jacob, who, with one of those flashes
of insight which often illumined his sombre intelligence‚ first
perceived the explanation of those remarkable transpositions in
Book Ι which Scaliger had with such facility and certainty cor-
rected. He devotes to the problem only a long footnote in his
pamphlet De Manilio Poeta ² ,- but although some of his calcula-
