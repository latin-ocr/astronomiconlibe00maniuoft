INTRODUCTION 111

only editor who adds anything to Scaliger that is worth speaking
of. He is generously praised by Bentley, and he deserves remem-
brance as a man of multifarious learning in a generation and place
where it was not common. His pictorial presentment of the two
celestial hemispheres is still the most beautiful and usable thing of
its kind that is to be found in editions of Manilius.

Four years aster Sherburne appeared the 13ehssnn edhfion of
Michael Du Fay, who appropriates to himself the fruits of all
these scholars’ labours. Du Fay was not himself a man of original
mind or fine critical discernment. But his work is an interesting
example of the manner in which the zeal of second-rate scholars
so often achieves results of far-reaching benefit. Scaliger, as I said,
did not much care to help the stupid—or even the mere beginner:
he did not understand either class. Du Fay was neither a stupid
nor an ignorant man 3 but he had sympathy with, and knowledge
of, the needs of such men. To the extent of his knowledge he is
a good teacher‚ but with a faulty critical judgement. It is fashion-
able to disparage him.¹ Yet save for his assistance the students
of Manilius would be fifty per cent. fewer than they are. His
Index Verborum is indispensable. His Latin paraphrase, though
now and again it shirks a difficulty, is the work of a competent
man. Again and again it tacitly corrects the blunders of Scaliger:
in many places it will be found still right where all later editors
arc still wrong. It has been of service to men of much finer
talents than Du Fay's ; and even the great Bentley, who speaks so
contemptuously of ‘ bonus Fayus ', will be found to owe to it more
than he acknowledges. Ι should perhaps even say that he has
sometimes stolen from it.

Du Fay had some prejudice against Scaliger3 but he was too
careful a man to let it run away with him. In a lengthy Appendix,
however, he prints the Am'madvem·i0nes in Manilium et Scaltgeri
Notas of a scholar whose prejudice against Scaliger was greater
than his own,² as was also his competence to criticize him—Huet.
Huet, in a few brief words towards the close of the Animadver-
simm, allows handsomely the merits of Scaliger, and speaks justly

¹ Not only Housman but Ellis (Hermathena, 1908, p. 167) and Jacob <De
Man„ p. 3⁴12 speak of him with great severity. Already only eighteen years
after his book had appeared, Creech had spoken of him as ‘the miser-able
wretched Fayus⁷ (Creech, Pres„ p. 15).
