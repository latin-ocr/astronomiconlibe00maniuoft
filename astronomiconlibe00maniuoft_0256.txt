11 887—902 COMMENTARY

which is highest (it is fastigium) is always most venerated; (2) by
a play upon words, since the regio os the M.C. belongs to Venus
(922—6); cf. Plaut. Poen. 278 ‘Venerem uenerabor’: Carm. de Mensibus
13, Ρ. L. Μ., Baehr. i. 207. For plays upon words in Manilius and
elsewhere see note on 410.

locatur: dicatur MSS. So at 952 the locatur of G marg. and
codd. dett. is plausibly corrected by Bentley to dicatur. [dicatur is,
however, perhaps just possible, of the sors regarded as a templum, cs.
templa in 943.

890. fortunae crede regenti: the sors felix is not the sors
Fortunae ; yet the presence in it of Jupiter carries with it asa corollary
the presence of a Fortuna. Jupiter and Fortuna are associated in
more than one Italian cult. Fortuna, according to Cicero De Div.
ii. 85, was the mother of Jupiter. Elsewhere she is the child of
Jupiter (Fortuna Iouis puer), the Fortuna Primigenia of the much
vexed Praeneste inscription, C. l. L. xiv, 28633 cf. 2862, 2868. Gaidoz,
it is worth noting here, regards Fortuna as originally a solar divinity;
hence her wheel, or globe (Etudes de Mytliolcgie Gau lozse i. 56 sqq..)
The Fortuna of 927 is clearly reminiscent of the Fortuna Virilis of
whom Ovid speaks at Fasti iv. 133 sqq., who came gradually to be
confused withp Venus. (See &Vardo Fowler Roman Festz’vals, pp.
67- 8,161 sqq., 223 sqq.)

891— 904. The fifth regi,o overhangingl. M. C.

891. huic in peruersum similis: wrongly explained by Breiter,
who takes in peruersum as= zn part m z''nfelzcem. No: the fifth
regio is like its diametrical opposite, the eleventh, m that it isjust above
Ι. M. C„ while the eleventh is just below M. C. 3 that is, its relation to
its cardo is similar to that of the eleventh to its cardo, only inverted
(in peruersum).

haec peruersissima sunt .· scribe in transuersum, Postgate.

892. cingens fulcimina: so Ι have corrected for the contingent
(= elingent> fulmina of MSS. Scaliger, followed by Breiter, keeps
fulmina as =fulmenta. But, while fulmenta is connected with the
root offulcio, fulmina is connected, surely, with that of fulgeo.
Du Fay’s culmina (which Bentley produces as his own) is, as Breiter
remarks, appropriate only to M. C.

fulcimina is another of those rare Ovidian words affected by this
most Ovidian poet.

893. sub acta: su pacta G, with a rare fidelity, fier acta cett.
defessa sub acta became by a haplography defessa hacta (pacta),
which was ingeniously emended to per acm in LM. Not only is sub
acta the more Manilian expression, but 251, ‘sub emerito considens
orbe laborum,' furnishes an exact parallel.

895. subitura iugum: ‘to take upon its shoulders tlte scales '—the
cardinal sign of the 1. M. C. being, in the thema mundi, Libra3 but
there is, of course, a play on subire iugum = ‘to pass under the yoke.'
See note on 887.

896. onus mundi : onus as Luc. iv, 58 iustae pondera Librae.

898. inuersus, Housman, rightly, for inuersa : see Ellis' note where,
while recommending inuerso, Ellis shows that in uersu, the usual
correction, is unlikely.

899. nomenque: momenque, Ellis, comparing Lucr. iii. 145, paret
et ad numen mentis momenque monetur3 and to this M 's demouenque

erha s oints.
