ASTRONOMICON 11

that which fortune has made to be truth? Shall he set
himself against the verdict of so high an oracle?

This theme arn I fain with inspired breath to lift to the
starS. Not in the crowd, nor for the crowd, will I build
my rhyme. But alone I will drive my car at large in
unencumbered course, where none shall meet me and none
as I travel make his speed to bear me company. But
1 will speak secret things unto the heavens: the stars shall
hear me and marvel: the song of its prophet shall make
glad the universe. They also shall marvel unto whomsoever
the stars have given it to know themselves and their holy
motions. Few are they, few indeed, upon the earth.
Swiftly pass and are gone those that love riches and gold
and mastery and office, or sost ease and quiet days and
subtle languorous music and sense of sweetness stealing
through the eam, who think with light laboui· to win to
a knowledge of fate. No: to know the rule of sate comes
by gift of fate.

First must my song mark clearly the differing nature of
stars according to their sex, Six male are there3 and the
female, of whom the Bull is first, are of like number.
Behold how the Bull, as he returns to his place, rises with
· his hinder quarters foremost and arches his form. The sex
of the signs alternates, each different from its neighbour,
through the whole circle of the Zodiac. Some thou wilt
see to be of human form, and their temper not remote
therefrom. Others will give to us the disposition of cattle
and wild beasts. Certain of them are single signs, moving
each in its own province alone. These must be marked
and learned with care.

Consider now the double signs. Being doubled they
will exercise upon us an influence powerful by reason of
their allied condition„ Much does either partner give to
the other and take away: and the signs which exercise
this joint sway are powerful to shape such destinies as
hang undecided between good and evil. Eehold‚ across the
stars, the two Fishes, and the naked forms of the Twin
Brothers. The Twins abide linked together, each with an
arm about the other. The Fishes sace opposite ways and
travel in different directions Both signs agree in being
twosold: but they differ in their nature. Of the twin signs
these, then, move rejoicing in undiminished bodily glory.
