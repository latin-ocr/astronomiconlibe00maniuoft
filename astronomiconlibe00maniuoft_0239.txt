COMMENTARY 652—81

Maniliano the whole os what has been said of the squares, and should
therefore stand immediately before 673, For the reason of their
trajection see note on 649-50. The cause of the trajection of 683—6
seems undiscoverable ; so too that of 670.

659. Caper brumam genitusque adfrigora Piscis: Ellis rightly
defends the text against Bentley’s violent alteration. capricorn is
half goat, half fish3 and Manilius, when he adds Piscis to Caper
(which was intelligible alone) causam petit ex natura rerum cur
frigidum brumae tempus Capricorno tribuatur ,· nimirum fiwgidz'ssima
est natura Piscium.

666. sine compare: so Dorville (with the genius of a better man)
for sine corpore. Du Fay explains sine corpore by totus enim pes est
Scorpius. sine quoquam esse dicitur Scorpius argute, quoa' omni
societate caret, Jacob3 argutiae magis Iacobeae quam Alanilianae ,f
Ellis conjectures at Lucr. iv. 897 the same confusion corpore—
compare] [Ovid Met. vii. 830 metuit sine corpore—whence perhaps
our text.

672. una sub imagine natos: editors have either emended or mis·
interpreted these words through failure to pereeive that the subject of
signant is the signs of the third square. Du Fay, concealing his
ignorance, renders by natos sub eadem similitudine3 Jacob, not caring
to conceal his, by ab eisdem minoribus natos. Breiter follows Jacob
blindfold: ‘wohl die Mitglieder eines und desselben Geschlechtes,
welche gleiche imagines haben! But Manilius is speaking of affines.
Pompey and Caesar were affine5‚ but they had not the same imagines,
they were not ‘eines und desselben Geschlechtes ’.

At 188 Manilius speaks of Sagittarius as duplici formatus imagine.
Similarly he might have spoken of e. g. Taurus as by contrast unasor-
malus imagine. Intelligibly he might have gone on to speak of persons
born under Taurus as nna sub imagine natos. 670—1, then, mean that
the square of the single signs Taurus, Leo, Scorpion, Sagittarius,
‘ guard affines and propinqui, protecting those born under single
signs.

sub imagine: Germ. Arat. 277, 354 ; Aetna 863 Ovid Met. ii. 37,
iii. 250 ; Calpurn. iv. 1433 Gratius Cyn. 326.

684. quae: the antecedent is simplicia signa (664), but by implica-
tion also signa duplici conexa figura (660).

669. numeris aut tempore: either as quarto quaeque loco posita
merely, or as cardinal signs.

673. longior in spatium: what is here said is more clearly ex-
plained at 350-5.

675. The construction is haec ad amicitias imitantis iura gradum-
que sanguinis nos ducunt el ad pectora animis haerentia. The
order is confused, but animis haerentia is in antithesis to genere
coniuncta, as appears from 683-43 cf. pectore amicitiae in 582.
Perhaps adque animis. pondera, Postgate coll. 956, v, 4523 Prop. ii.
2 . 22.

5678. maioribus: sc. quam ea interualla quae cognatos separant.

For the spondeiazon cf. v, 314 producitur interuall03 ν. 412
rimabitur argumentis. maioribus interuallis is taken from Lucr. ii.
295, cf. iv. 187. Verg. Aen. ν. 320 has proximus interuallo (Cramer).

679. putant : with a touch of scepticism (sor pathos).

possunt: perhaps possint.

681. Sigus which are next to one another aid neighbours, signs
removed from one another by one sign guests.
