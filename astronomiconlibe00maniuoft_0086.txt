INTRODUCTION III

Dulcinius hands on the influence of Bonincontrius (and of the
Bologna edition) to Aldus Manutius. Aldus' edition (Venice, 1499
——reprinted at Reggio in Lombardy‚ 1503), though Mr. Housman
praises it as possessing ‘character of its own ' (p. xiii), has, so far
as my examination of it goes (Book ΙΙ), less individuality (apart
from its beautiful type) than any text that I have looked at.
Where it differs from Dulcinius it differs for the worse. Its real
importance consists in the fact that it arrested Manilian criticism
for nearly a century. Its large and beautiful type satisfied the eye
and lulled to sleep the critical conscience. The Roman edition of
1 510, Pruckner 1533 and 1551, and the miniature text of Antonius
Molinius¹ (1551 and 1561), are all content to reproduce the
Aldine with very little alteration.

‘Itaque uides paucis datum esse in his literis sapere. Frustra
labor et uigiliae operas contribuunt nisi ab ingenio adiuuentur.'
So Scaliger, in one of his letters,2 sums up not unfairly the achieve-
ment of his predecessors (and contemporaries) in Manilian study.
The name of Scaliger still seems to stand, as it stood to Dan.
Heinsius3 when Scaliger died, not for some one learned man,
but for learning itself. And his editions of Manilius are magni-
ficent monuments of his erudstion, of the vigour and freshness
of his mind, of his untiring research, of his swift penetration.
'I‘he text of Manilius which he had to work with when he
began was not much superior to that furnished by an average
Renascence MS. Editors had done little, and they had done
much of it badly. With no good MS. to help him Scaliger set
himself to create a readable text. His sense for Latinity‚ if we com-
pare him with an intuitive Latinist like N. Heinsius, was defective.⁴

¹ Why Molinius has met with so much favour among modern editors it
would be difficult to say. Cramer finds in him not above ten new readings;
and 1 have never (save in one place) found a reading attributed to him in
a modern Apparatus which 1 have not subsequently traced to some prior
edition.

⁴ But he avoids Heinsius’ worst fault. ‘Ganz srei ist Scaliger von der
Sucht, an der sehon zu seiner Zeit fast alle Kritiker‚ noch mehr nach ihm
N. Heinsius und seine Nachsolger, krankten—von der Sucht‚ die Lateinischen
eleganter zu machen als sie vor uns liegen. Dagegen mutet er ihnen
zuweilen unerhorte Harten zu oder Geschmackloses‘ (Haupt, Opusc. iii.
33). Nic. Heinsius is perhaps not to be acquitted os the narrow ambition
which Scaliger censures in his letter to Joannes Stadius: ‘nam gloriolam
