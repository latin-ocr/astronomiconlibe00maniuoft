COMMENTARY 7 36—40

Ι think that 730 (though I have not attempted to restore the line) may
have been inserted to guard against this very error. (The same
suggestion is made in Bonincontrius.)
738-49. What is meant by the ‘ dodecatemory of a dodecatemory ⁹.

‘Learn in brief what it is that is called the dodecatemory of
a dodecatemory. For the dodecatemory (id) is distinguished into five
parts (half-degrees), for such is the number of the so-called planets
that shine pre-eminent in heaven3 and each planet takes to itself
a half-degree, and in it exercises sway and influence. We must note
therefore in what dodecatemory the planets are at any moment
stationed. For in any sign, within the confines of whatever dode-
catemory a planet has entered, that planet will work powerful results
in the influences of that dodecatemory!

In other words a dodecalemorion dodecatemom'z' is the fifth part of

a dodecatemory—the five half—degrees of each dodecatemory being
assigned among the five planets.

The dadecatemom'i dodecatemorion is peculiar to Manilius, nor is
his account of it reproduced in Firmicus. As a consequence a good
deal of controversy has arisen round these twelve lines—most of which
does not admit of a settlement. Breiter wishes to get rid of the
dodecatemorz'z' dodecatemorion altogether, and to this end he pronounces
the whole of 740 from quid . . . to 743 . . . dicuntur the work of an
interpolator. This suggestion—textually highly arbitrary-is rightly
said by Bouche-Leclercq to be in itself useless. Yet Bouche-Leclercq's
own treatment of the passage is almost as unsatisfactory. He imagines
Manilius—if I understand him aright—(I) to have interpreted the
planetary ὅρια or termini (for which see e. g. Du Fay's tables ad lac.)
as being each one-sixtieth of a sign3 and (2‘) to have confused
dodecatemory in the sense of a sign, a twelfth of the Zodiacal Circle
(for this sense see e.g. Geminus, chap. i), with dodecatemory in the
sense of one-twelfth of a sign.

The answer to all this is that nothing in Manilius’ account of
the dodecatemorli dodecatemorion (so far as it goes) is in the least
degree confused or obscure. All, for what it is worth, is clear and
explicit. In fact the only real difficulty that arises is one which seems
to have been made for, and not by, Manilius. Why is the dodecatemoriz·
dodecatemorion so called? Why not rather dodecatemorii pemptc-
mon'on?—for that is what it is. The phrase occurs only at 741, and
it is not certain that the text is sound3 for the words namque id per
quinque notatur parles seem to imply that Manilius had written not
dodecatemorz'on but pemptemorion. Something like (740—1) ⁶ dode-
catemorii quota sit (quod codd„ cf. 713) quod dicitur esse pars
pemptemorion’ is, perhaps, just possible (=qu0la pars (signi) sit
(id) quod dicitur esse dodecatemorlz' pezllptemorion).

738-40 (739). Ι am surprised that it has occurred to no previous
editor to remove 739 from its present place. It followed the last line
of a page in our archetype, cf. Introduction, p. xxiv (this no doubt
assisted the transposition in M of 740 and 741), and its removal at
once gives sense to the lines which it separates. Ι have transferred it
to a place after 822, where see note.

740, dodecatemorii: Bentley pointed out that only here (studii in
iv. 123 should be studia et) does Manilius use the double -ἰ form
in the genitives of substantives in -ιίιε, and -z‘um3 and he saw in this
an indication that Manilius falls within the Augustan age and
influence. Bentley thought it possible that Manilius actually wrote
