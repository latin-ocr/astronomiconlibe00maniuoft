INTRODUCTION III

which Bechert¹ speaks of as Scaliger's second edition, is merely
a reprint of the text and commentary of 1579, accompanied by the
Variae Lectiones of Franciscus Junius. What Scaliger thought of
this work may be seen from his Lelters‚ pp. 165, 173-4 (1625),
where the asterisks—as we are instructed by the Clavis of
Colomesius ²-hide the name of Junius 3 from the Scaligerana s.v. ;
or from a number of notes in Manilius,³ ed. 2. What Junius
himself thought of it may be seen from a letter of his preserved in
Burmann’s Sylloge, i, p. 411. ‘ flagro admonendus' is Scaliger’s
rough comment in one place upon this foolish man. Yet posterity
owes to Junius a deep debt. For his work seems to have stung
Scaliger into an indignation ⁴ which could only be laid to rest by
the publication of his own edition in a revised form. Junius had
employed Bonincontrius‚ and he had obtained some report of the
readings of G.⁵ And for his second edition Scaliger studied care-
fully both these authorities. The second edition appeared in
1 600. Scaliger meditated, and made collections for, a third edition.
His material for this work passed ultimately into the hands of
J. H. Boekler (Boeclerus), a Professor in Upsala, who embodied
it in an edition which saw the light in Strasburg in 1655. This
edition was prefaced by the notes upon Manilius of Thomas
Reinesius and of the astronomer Ismael Bullialdus (Bouilleau).
These notes have little value (save perhaps for Bullialdus’ conjec-
ture ‘ reddis sic oribus ora ’ at II. 96).G

terme”) to make out the sense of Manilius in these difficult places.') See
p. xl.

Scaliger's first edition should perhaps be more used than it is. In external
form (it is an excellently printed small quarto volume> it is greatly superior
to its successor : and the Commentary does not suffer from overloading, but
is full of brief, direct, and forcible notes—the whole is contained in 68 small
pages. Moreover, to judge Scaliger's powers truly, it is worth while to
observ-e what he can do without Gcmblacensis.

³ e. g. in Book 11. 147, 153, 158. 228, 230, 279, &c. In each case the
allusion is to Junius, though he is nowhere named—Scaliger did not mean
to make this sool famous.

4 In the Scaltgerana (s. v. Junius) he is spoken of with extraordinary
bitterness. Funerum Liber xii, Poemata, p. 105 (1615), is a very lukewarm
palinode.

⁵ Cf. e. g. his note on p. 56.

ὓ All extant copies os Scaliger's second edition seem to be dated 1600.
But a portion of the issue must, 1 think, have appeared in 1599. Casaubon‚
Epist. (Magdeburg‚ 1656), p. 208, writes to Scaliger on vi Kal. Aug. 1599:
