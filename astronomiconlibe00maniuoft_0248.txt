11 749-7 5 COMMENTARY

passage save ⁴ rationem miscere '. (For the same technical sense of
miscere see Firm. ii. 1 init„ ii. 8. 4.) Bentley is refuted by the fact
(strangely not hitherto adduced) that Quintilian (Praes. 23) uses
rationem admiscere exactly as Manilius here uses rat. misc.; cf.
diuidenda est ratio eorum Quint. xi. 1. 15 ; and see ib. iii. 6. 55.

750-87. We must begin with elements. We must get the material
for our building before we build. On this passage is modellecl the
whole of Firmicus i. iv. 12-13‚ Kroll‚ p. 14.

756. usus: ‘Aussprache’, Breiter3 why Ι know not. Manilius
simply says, ‘You teach a child the appearance and forms of letters
first, and put the use of them before him afterwards. tum ponitur
usus is no more than priusquam ponitur usus; it expresses in a brief
general way what is said with detail in the two succeeding lines. It
does not mark a stage between facies-et-nomen and syllaba, stru-
ctura, &c.

757. suis syllaba nodis: ‘ das Verkm'jpfen der Laute’‚ says
Breiter. But it is,1 think, possible that the child is being taught
writing (as well as reading ?), see on 7603 nodi will there be ‘ pothooks
and hangers'. (Scaliger compares Auson. Ep. xxi. 38 trinodem
dact lum.)

738. ‘Then comes the building of words which have to be bound
together through their parts.’

membra: Scaliger (and Bentley) for uerba which Breiter retain53
here = syllabas. [At Verg. Aen. x. 639 there is the same confusion of
membra and uerba in the excellent Codex Gudianus, at JuV. x. 198
membra P3 uerba L.]

ligandis is my own correction for legendi. Breiter’s (=F. Junius)
legenti (sc. puero) Ι take to be not Latin 3 to ‘ read through ¹ is not legere
per. For ligandis cf. Stat. Th. v. 61 3-14 ubi uerba ligatis imperfecta
sanis ,θ Censorinus x. 5 litterae nostrae . . . saepe nec uerbis nec syllabis
copulandis concordabunt.

759. rerum uires : the possibililies of his material.

760. First the child learns the forms, ἃς, of single letters; he
next connects into syllables, suis nodz's3 then he binds a whole word
together per membra. When he can write (or read) whole words he
proceeds to the final cause of all this, to the art of writing (or speaking)
in its highest manifestation—artistic writing‚ poetry. Cf. Plato Prot.
324—6.

764-3. I have with some hesitation accepted Breiter's transposition
of these two lines, and the old correction in 764 effluat for et (ut) fluat.
Ellis (with the traditional order) retains et fluat, for uersaque quae
proposing ingeniously uertas quae. Jacob retaining uersaque (with
effluat) makes it = et si uersa erunt3 quod durius fortasse nonnullis
uidebitur’, as Ellis says suavely.

768. ‘ Recalling by the methods of science the power by which the
god rules.' Scaliger reads quaque . . . ab arce3 and so Bentley
· calling divinity from the height where the god reigns’. artem
Immisch‚ which Housman (C. R. xiv, pp. 466 sq.) pronounces ‘ certain'.

769. per partes: i. q. gradibus in 770: ‘the faith of the learner must
be led on, line upon line '; first the parts, then the whole.

775. quaerit opes: so 1 have written for uertit opus. Querit losing
its initial = umit, which became inevitably uertit. opus and opes are
confused again at iv, 169. Breiter retains uertit and comments: ‘ er
'andert das Werk, indem er lauter Vorbereiten anordnet, Material
schafft.' How can he ‘andern das Werk' before he has begun it?
