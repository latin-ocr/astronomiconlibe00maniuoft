ASTRONOMICON II

sor ever ignorant of themselves and of law, yet, recalled by
nature to the sense of that universe which begat them, list
their minds and wait upon the heavens and the stars. They
wash their bodies when the growing moon first shoots its
horns, they watch the coming of the storm and the return
of fair weather. How beholding this should one hesitate to
link man with the heaven? Nature has given to him fore-
thought and speech and apt intelligence and swiftness of
spirit. Into him alone has God descended and dwells in
him and seeks himself in man's seeking of him. I say
nothing of other arts that are permitted to us, albeit
uncertain, gifts beyond our competence. I pass by the
fact that nothing is given to us perfect in law and order,
that our guides, as is clear, are not men of all-surpassing
mind. I pass by the fact that fate is sure and inevitable,
and that it belongs to matter to endum—and to the
universe to exercise‚—compulsion. But yet—who could
avail to know the heavens except by the boon of heaven,
who to find God save one that is himself a portion of the
gods? Who could have surveyed and compassed in his
narrow mind the great fabric of the boundless sky, the
circling motions of the signs, the flaming bounds of the
— universe, the eternal war of the planets with the fixed stars
[and the earth and sea that lie beneath the sky and all that
lies under both sky and earth]—who indeed P—-were it not
in man's spirit nature had put these seeing eyes, directing
to herselfa mind one in kind with herself, unfolding to him
all her mighty works? who indeed, but that of heavenly
origin is the mystery that ever calls us heavenward‚ to the
fellowship of nature and to the primal laws which the stars
ordain at our birth? It were impiety to take captive an
unwilling universe and to bring it down in thraldom unto
that earth which itself is.

But it is not meet with wandering words to seek credence
for that which is manifest. Now shall the truth of things
make plain the strength and truth that is in the workings
of nature. For Reason neither deceives nor is deceived
ever. We must follow duly in the way wherein true
principle assures us against error. Then does the issue
follow even as it was foretold. Shall a man dare call false
