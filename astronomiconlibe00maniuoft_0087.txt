MANILIUS AND HIS EDITORS

But he possessed, what was above all needed for re-ordering the
textos Manilius, a power of trenchant thinking which detected
unreason where it was obvious and insisted everywhere on tolerable
sense and consistency. As a consequence Scaliger noted at once
the existence at several points in the text of transpositions affecting
whole passages.¹ What a sober man must have made of Book Ι
before Scaliger rearranged the transposed portions it is difficult to
imagine 3 for Bonincontrius in these passages is not like a sober
man.² These things Scaliger set in order ; and at the same time,
by his strong sense for what was rational, he was able in innu—
merable places to correct single words and whole lines in the text
with a πειθανοίγκη which has never been surpassed by more elegant
scholars. Auratus‚ in an epigram at the beginning of Scaliger’s first
edition (1579), calls the Manilius ‘ Herculeum opus' 3 and indeed
Scaliger rid the land of monsters.³ Many of his emendations of
course are blundering, someincredible. Yet no editor has in any
one author so often replaced the false by the true, and it is no idle
boast when on the title page of the second edition he speaks of the
text as ‘ infinitis mendis repurgatum ². Scaliger had acquired also

Α a vast knowledge of the ancient literature relevant to the subject

of the Astronomica—much of it then unedited. This he turned to
the very best account, and the pages of his Commentary are
infinitely richer than those of any other editor in wealth of illustra-
tive material. A good deal of this material is irrelevant, but most
of it is interesting, and life is longer than we commonly allow.
In exegesis, in the actual explanation of difficulties, in assisting the
reader to follow the consecution of his author’s ideas, Scaliger is
not, I think, particularly successful. His intolerance of stupid
people disposed him not to make his Commentary too helpful. It
is said also by those who are competent to judge that his know-
ledge of astronomy was poor. This is urged by Huet, whose
knowledge of astronomy was good. How far itis true, or how far,

ex nescio quarum uocularum commutationibus aucupari, angusti est animi’
(Opusc. Van, 1610, p. 356).

¹ This was Scaliger’s principal achievement in the first edition. His
finest emendations belong to the edition of 1600.

² See Scaliger, ed. 2, Prolegomena, p. 7.

³ Dan. Heinsius told Gevartius that he had often heard Scaliger say that
his Manilius was, after the Emendatio, his best work, and the one on which
he most prided himself (MS. note in a Bodleian copy of Manilius, Auct. S.
2. 23).
