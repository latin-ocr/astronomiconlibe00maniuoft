side the popular thought of the time. Nearer to our purpose are
Horace and Propertius.

Seu Libra seu me Scorpios aspicit
formidolosus, pars uiolentior
natalis horae, seu tyrannus
Hesperiae Capricornus undae,
utrumque nostrum incredibili modo
consentit astrum: te Iouis impio
tutela Saturno refulgens
eripuit.

So Horace to Maecenas—and we must suppose his astrology to
have been intelligible not only to Maecenas but to the general
reader. Less elaborate, but hardly less instructive, is the language
of Epp. ii. 2. 187, ‘scit Genius, natale comes qui temperat
astrum.⁷¹ Elsewhere he2 speaks of essaying ³ Babylonios
numeros '‚ in a manner which implies that such appeals to the
astrologer's art were familiar and understood. But the know-
ledge of astrological practice demanded by Horace of his readers
is as nothing compared with that postulated by Propertius in the
first elegy of the fourth book. A good deal of that poem (7 5-86,
107-8) is still obscure to students of astrology3 and the whole
poem in its conception, as well as in its detail, implies in the
average Roman a considerable interest in, and knowledge of, the
methods of astrologers. Parts of the Ibis, again, of Ovid‚ and
much of the Aselamorplwses, point the same lesson. In fact the
whole literature of the period bears witness to the immense
fascination which the mysteries of astrology exercised upon the
mind of the average cultivated Roman.

Tiberius, like Augustus, was no enemy of astrology. In
Thrasyllus he had his Theagenes— and more soff· Yet, sur-
rounded ‘cum grege Chaldaeo ⁷,4 he none the less had that
peevish mistrust in his destiny which frequently afflicts men
whose greatness is inherited. But the edict of Α. D. 16 was not
to his liking. ‘Expulit et mathematicos,’ says Suetonius ⁵—appa-
rently with reference to this edict—*sed deprecantibus ac se
artem desituros promittentibus ueniam dedit.' The astrologers
