MANILIUS AND I-llS EDITORS

but with restraint of his deficiencies. Yet his notes as a whole
are ungenerous and even carping. In many places he undoubtedly
sets Scaliger right in matters both of astrology and of Latin. And
just as he can see the faults in Scaliger, so he can see the faults in
the text of Manilius. But only very rarely does he heal these latter.
His touch in emendation is heavy, and the debt of Manilian
scholarship to him will never be more than that he was quick to
diagnose disorders which he was incompetent to cure.¹ ‘Acutis-
simus Huetius,' Bentley calls him. And he was a man not only
of great ‘acuteness’ of mind but of a very extended learning(³ In
scholarship‚ in astronomy, in chemistry, in alcheniy, in philosophy,
he was a competent practitioner3 and his interest in learned
pursuits was everywhere genuine. But the faults of his Manilius
are the faults of all his work—the faults os the author of the
Traite' de la Foiblesse, of a man, that is, devoid ultimately of a
real devofion to trussn or perhaps of a benef hi n. 'rhss is
why his A nimadnersiones will, in any student of Manilius who
has felt at all deeply the influence of Scaliger, always excite ini-
patience. His dislike of Scaliger was probably in part theological.
But it is in any case unfortunate that the only man in Europe
who was capable of appreciating Scaliger's Manilius should be
chiefly remembered for animadversions upon it of a kind rather
mean and trifling.

I would enter here a plea for a Manilian student whom I have
never seen praised by any one, but a student who had some
scholarship, a real appreciation of Manilius, and much good sense
and tame—ssshonum (keech. (heech pubhshed in London hi
1697 a metrical translation of the whole of Manilius. In the
Preface to that book (p. lxviii, cf. p. 88) he speaks of ‘a Latin
edition of his (Manilius’) works which I shall think myself obliged
to undertake, unless a very learned gentleman, from whom Ι have
long expected it, frees me from that trouble and obliges the world
with his own observations'. The ‘very learned gentlenian’ is,
I suppose, Bentley3 and Creech died some forty years before
Bentley's edition saw the light. (It was perhaps well that he did
not try to forestall Bentley.) Bentley, Ι think, nowhere mentions
