II 106-1 14 COMMENTARY

. . . to . . . animum is semz‘-parenthetic; then the quem carries us
back rather abruptly to hominem in 105; quem denique in unum
descendit deus. ,eum quis dubitet caelo coniungere?

Ι formerly, to avoid the awkwardness which this involves ,proposed,
for eximi,um eximo quodi (i. q. mztlo quod) with quod demque in 107
(C. Q April, 1908). But we must remember that the Astronomi'ca is
an unfinished work, and this passage, like a good many others, has
not received Manilius’ ultima manus.

Breiter retains eximimn, as a subst.=exz‘mias res—to which 1 know
not what to say. (Seneca Phoen. 238 et ingeni solertis eximium decus.)

105—14. The connexion of ideas is very obscure. Man has affinity
with the divine mundus. Seeing that the animals have this (=post
haec, 105), then so a fortiori must man. But, apart from this, nature
has given him purpose and speech and intelligence and a swiftness of
spirit, which shows the presence in him of God. Man seeks God:
buthe can only do so because God guides his seeking. God seeks
himself (se ipse requirit) in man’s seeking of him (106—8). That it is
God that guides man’s seekings we may see pre-eminently (putting
aside other indications—mitlo . . . mitto—omitting what is noted in
109-14) from the study of astronomy (115-16) ; sor who could hope to
find the mundus nisi qui pars ipse deorum est? In 109-14 proofs that
man’s search is directed by God are found in certain arts other than
astronomy (alias 109), yet these, though permitted to man, are
uncertain (ῑφψιίας) and not wholly within human competence (110);
therefore Manilius will not press them into the service of his argument
(mztto). Moreover, nothing in any department of human inquiry has
been granted to us aequalz sub leoe— all clear and in order (111) 3 our
authorities are not men of the highest talents (112)· , how then could
we hope lo find God unless God guz‘ded us? Yet this argument also
vtitto„ Again, fate is fixed and inevitable ; it belongs to the mundus
to compel, to matem‘es to be compelled (113—14). Yet man’s search
for God shows that lle z's nol mere materies, but pars mundi.

In the above analysis Ι have italicized those amplifications of
Manilius' argument which it seemed to me necessary to make in
order to bring out the connexion of ideas. But I am bound to say that
the more I reflect on this passage the more obscure I find it.

108. descendit deus: uel uatz'cinatus est de Christo uel dic appellare
animum nostrum deum, Bonincontrius.

Seneca Epp. xxxi. 11 quid aliud uoces lmnc quam deum in corpore
humano hospitantem? ⁴ In Man the god descends, and joys to find
The narrow image of his greater mind ² (Creech).

Cf. iv. 910 (the converse of this).

109. mitto: this form of address, in the first person, is not, Ι think,
found elsewhere in Manilius. Yet mitte can hardly be right. See
Jacob’s note. For mitto see L. Mueller De Re Asetr. p. 337 (1861).

111. aequali lege: as 233.

tributum : i. q. pemm'ssum, as 605.

112. pectoris: corporis codd. The confusion is a common one
even in good MSS.

113. fatum: Lact. Instz’t. iv. 9 Zeus rerum naturae dzkpositorem
atque opgficem uniuersitatis λόγον praedicat quem et salum et necessi-
tatem rerum et deum et animum Iouis nuncupat.

114. Diog. vii. 134 δοκεῖ δ αὐτοῖς (the Stoics) ἀρχαι εἶναι τῶν ὅλων
δύο, τὸ ποιοῦν και τὸ πάσχον. τὸ μὲν ουν πάσχον εινηι την ι”ιποιον οὐσίαν,
τὴν ὕλην. τὸ δὲ ποιοῦν τὸν ἐν αὐτῇ λόγον, τὸν θεόν.
