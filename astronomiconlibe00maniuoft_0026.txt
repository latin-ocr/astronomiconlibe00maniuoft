INTRODUCTION Ῑ

follow 442. This was before Ι had elaborated the pagination of A.
It now appears, since 442 was the last line of 9v, how easily 433
may have been first omitted and then inserted in the wrong place.
In its present place it involves an astronomical absurdity. (4) The
insertion of 463 a at the end of 11 r is due to Housman. (5) 743
was the last line of 17 v in A 3 but its proper place, as Postgate
perceived‚ and as every one now agrees, is after 739. It dropped
out after 739 and was added at the end of the page. When Post-
gate suggested this transposition, he was, I believe, not aware‘of the
manner in which it accorded with the lineation of A. (6) After
765 there follows in all our MSS. a line which is really nothing
else than a corrupt version of II. 3. It was no doubt written at the
end of 18 r as what we should call a cross-reference: it was a cita-
tion of a parallel which has got carried into the text. (7) There
can be no doubt that 811-12 are spurious. Bentley ejected the
whole of 809—12. But Jacob points out that some mention here
of the planets is essential 3 and we are thus obliged to ,retain
809-10. But 811-12 are not thus essential, and are on the face
of them scholastic : cf. V. 6-7. They no doubt stood in the lower
margin¹ of 19 r.

When we pass to Book ΙΙ, with which I am here more directly
concerned‚ the problem of reconstituting our archetype is not so
simple. There are not in this book, as there are in Book Ι, trans-
positions of whole folia which enable us to say with certainty that
this or that line was the last of a leaf or page. However, we do
carry over from Book I the knowledge that each of the pages in
Book II will contain 22 lines. Look now at lines 120, 208, 231-2‚
343—4. These are all versus irrepticl'i: indeed, 34 3-4 are merely
318-19 repeated. Consider now the intervals which separate
them. 120—208 = 88 line83 between 208 and 231 lie 22 lines;
and again between 232 and 343—4 lie 1 10 (22 >< 5) lines. In
other words, if 119, 207, 230, 342 had each been the last line of a
page in A, then 120 was the first line of a page, and 208, 231·²
must have stood in the lower margin of the page, outside the body
of the text ; while 343-4 stood, like 120, in the body of the text

¹ It follows that the transposition which Scaliger detected (809-12 follow
in GLM on 804) had not yet been accomplished in A. (1 number the lines
here according to Breiter's text.) But there must have been (to explain the
existence os the transposition in GLM) signs in A indicating that the lines
should be transposed.
