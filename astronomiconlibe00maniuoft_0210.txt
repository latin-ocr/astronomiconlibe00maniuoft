11 365—74 COMMENTARY

writers, e. g. Hydrochous, A egocerm, Carcinus. Yet when we remember
how strong was the tendency in MSS. to replace the unsamiliar by the
familiar, the survival in so many places of Greek forms even in words
long naturalized in Latin seems to point to a marked Grecising
tendency in Manilius. The Madrid MS., it is noteworthy‚ uhich
stands nearer to our archetype than any other (see Introduction,

pp {xvf sqq. )‚ is the one which most often preserves sor us those
Gree orins.

tum: so Bentley; quo MSS„ which Huet defends as = a qu03

quin Breiter, inappropriately lum (= tu) was no doubt lost, or
altered, on account oste following.

h 368. transita: i. q. omzssa3 not visited by the line of the first
exagon.

369. utque ea praetereas: not‘ so that you may not have to
hother about‘, but, as Scaliger rightly explains, ut incipias a ssgnis
t7ansi't25 m przore orbe;‘ you, the reader, pass by’ stands sor ‘the
line, as you watch it, passes by' . Hence the ῥ7αείε7εα777 of editors
prior to Scaliger’s second edition is wrong, though Du Fay retains
it——of whom Scaliger, prophetically, non quiuis sententiam huius
loci ca it.

φίλε sunt mihi singula dicta: quae ego uocaui singula (360),
{caliger; not, as Du Fay, &c., ‘ which I have just enumerated one

y one.

370. ex totidem: see on 182.

371. subeuntia : ‘si uerum est, significabit signa quae se inuicem
una interposito secuntur, transuersum uisum inter se non habere,’
Ellis, who proposes obeuntia (sc. circulum Zodiacz'). In 380
quod euntibus is usually taken as pointing to subeuntibus in the same
sense. ‘subeuntia sind eben die hexagona,’ says Breiter, blithely.
But subeuntia mgna, absolutely, can only mean caelo subeuntia,
i. e. erientiam and the only way of taking the present passage,
unemended, is to connect subeuntia and transuersos uisus; ‘they
flee, as they come under, a transverse gaze ⁵, ‘they shrink from the
transverse gaze which they encounter’. But the text is probably
corrupt.

372. inclinata acie: to this M ’5 inclinata cue seems doubtfully to
point (Bentley's inclinant aciem is palaeographically less near). Ellis
objects that z'mlinata acies would more naturally mean exercitus in
fugam uersu53 and this is true so far as it goes, but the same
ambiguity holds of actem εο7ιί7777ρ7ί at 497 (cf. 514), and of similar
uses in other writers. The context alone saves these passages from
ambiguity. After all ‘a broken line , in English, might mean exe7 citus
insugam uersus, but no one would so understand it in a geometrical
writer. The expression inclinata acie uidentur seems to me Manilian,
and parallel to iii. 403-4 neque enim circumuenit illum recta acie
(cf. ex recto 373).

Jacob's inclinat acue (incll'nant aenae, Ellis) is overlearned, and
it is doubtful whether ane can mean uirga (gromatica), as Jacob
takes it; see Ellis ad loc Moreover, ev en if ame— - uirga, it is not
correct to describe the uir ga of the hexagons as nimzs incli3nala it is
ninus tmtuosa, flexuosa, if you like; but it is not more indurata,
indeed less, than the uzrga of a triangle. [Juv. vi. 70 acne P: acii al.]

374. tertia: signs separated from one another by one intervening
sign. He is still speaking of the alterna szgna· cf. 572 (where
