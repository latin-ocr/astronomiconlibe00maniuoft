II 841—61 COMMENTARY

κεντρη, interualla cardinum, the spaces between the cardines, are also
of importance.

The four quadrants enumerated correspond to the four ages os man.

843. per maius dimensa: Si interrogas quo sensu accipiant per
maius nihil respondebunt, Bentley, who writes per quadrum. Manilius
says merely that the interualla are ‘measured out over a wider area’
(maius spatium understood out of interualla) than the cardines thern-
selves; ⁶ bestowing their influences in a wider extension than that of
the cardines.’ See note on 864 sqq.

844-5. curuatur: not only because we are following a rise, but
because we are following the Cz’rcle of Geniture.

The interuallum between Hor. and M. C. controls the earliest

ears of lise.
y 846-8. The interuallum between M. C. and I. M. C. controls boy-
hood and early youth.

849—51. quae pars occasu contermina quaeque: I have here
followed the more sincere tradition of M, which for the inter imum of
GL has interminum, pointing clearly to contermin—. The interuallum
which bordering on the O. C. C. also descends sub orbem —to the Ι. M. C.
—governs mature life. occasu contermina is simply the iuncta sub
occasu of 868. The quae pars . . . quaeque anticipates the subdivi-
sion of the interuallum in the later passage.

851. et propria serie uarioque, &c. ,Nec coniunctio et locum hic
habet .· nec propria serie quid sit qnisquam explicaverit, Bentley, who
changes et propria to peipetua. His criticism has force, if his correc-
tion has not persuasiveness. Pingre paraphrases, ‘ l'age mfir, que
fortifient le passe' meme et les lecons reiterees de l’experience', draw-
ing on both Du Fay and his own imagination. Perhaps set propior
serae.

852. redeuntis ab imo : so Ellis, truly, for redeunte sub imo.
‘ redeunte sub imo: substantiviert,’ says Breiter, with a perception of
Latin shadowy rather than substantive. ‘Beispiele bei Jacob ⁹, he
adds ; ‘wo allerlei Unsinn vorkomrnt ⁷, we might rejoin.

Bentley's quadrante sub imo —which Pingre' receives—has nothing
to recommend it, and would indeed be hardly intelligible. (The word
occurs only-—and in a diffexent sense—at iii. 284.) Housman's
redeunte sibimet 1 cannot understand.

The interuallum between Ι. Μ. C. and Hor. governs the last years
of life.

8 56-6 3. Every sign receives and transmits the influence of the partes
mundi (the partes mundi are the ‹luodecim loci which he is going to
enumerate; hence locus in 857).

857. inficitur: cf. 357 (uisus signorum) aera infectum demittit.

astris: probably here not ‘ planets ’ ; cf. 959-60.

859. caeloque remittunt: Bentley pronounces caelo ‘ignaue
dictum’. It probably means no more than partibus mundi.

860. mundi etenim natura: uincit (= uindi) enim natura codd„
which, as Jacob (conj. positura) and Ellis (conj. mensura) have per-
ceived, cannot be sound. (Editors interpret as loci natura, betraying
thereby an uneasiness which they do not openly express.) [mundi
natura, Lucr. v. 239.]

The subject of ministrat is not merely mundi natura, but mundi
natura nunc diues honore nnnc sterilis-qualifying epithets which
hardly suit positura or mensura.

861-2. et sidera propriis in finibus praetereuntia sui esse moris
