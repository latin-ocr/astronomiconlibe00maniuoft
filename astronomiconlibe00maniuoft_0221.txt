COMMENTARY 488-501

Fishes shining across the stars'. Yet fulgentis geminos audit . . .
Pisces, Housman3 a very wooden emendation, in which fulgentis is
otiose and the combination fulgentis geminos intolerable.) The two
difficulties uidet Pisces, Virgine mens capitur must be considered
together. Bentley's explanation, repeated by Breiter (noster lzlc
maluzt se poetam magzs quam astrologum ostendere: et sczensprudeus
schema deseruit ut Emopam et Iouem znducm et), is valueless. For
(1) if Manilius had merely wished Emopam et Iouem zndusere, he
could as well have done so by saying that Taurus beholds Virgo
(which is true), as by saying that Taurus loves Virgo (which is false) ;
(2) why, in any case, should Manilius, in addition, say that Taurus
beholds Pisces? What has that to do with Jove and Europa?

Nor is it possible to attribute to Manilius here either' ignorance or
carelessness; not ignorance, since at 492, 499, 503, 513 he shows
that he knows the facts; and not carelessness, smce at 488 the
statement that Taurus both hears Pisces and sees Pisces 15 of such
a character that its astrological impossibility would be immediately
patent to any one making it, for it involves an identification of βλέποντα
and ἀκούοντα. To say that ‘Demophilus’ or Paulus Alexandrinus
made this identification does not help us. Why does Manilius make
it only in the case (ff Pisces aud Taurus .?

The text is sound ;1 and what Manilius has written he seems to
have written with knowledge and deliberation. The explanation of
the problem which his words involve seems, however, no longer in
our power.

491. indutusque Ioui est: the series ipsa orationis (Bentley)
demands est. Scaliger's Iouem is not necessary, and his view that
Ioui is ablat. (asparlz', 726, iii. 395) is, of course, absurd ; sor, as Huet
says, Jupiter indutus erat Tauro, uou Taurus lone. Iupiter induit
Taurum, puts on Taurus as a disguise, and so Ioui Taurus indutus
est, Taurus is ‘put on' by Jupiter. [Luc. iv. 132 caesoque inducta
iuuenco: induta, Cod. [Woutepessulanus man. alt]

496. captatur: not ‘is loved ³, as Scaliger and all editors, 1 think,
except Huet, but ‘is hated'3 and so, too, 5183 cf. n. on 510. Not only
Latin, but, as 1 think, the schema which Manilius is following, makes this
interpretation certain. For, taking captare as = odisse, then it will be
found that each of the feminine signs is loved by a masculine sign
which it hates. (This can only be insen-etl sor Capricorn and Pisces,
of whose loves and hates we are told nothing.) This, and not the
ordinary view, is consistent with what is said elsewhere of the relations
of the sexes in the Zodiac, e. g. ii. 379-84, 388-90, 410—18. Itis
surprising that Bentley, when he truly, at 503, emended auditque to
oditque, did not remark on this resistance of the female signs to the
advances of the male; and still more surprising that subsequent
editors have not noticed this piquant feature of Manilius’ schema.

497.1e6: so always in Manilius (save ν. 698(.Ρ );) the elisions at
246, 523 point in the same direction. So ΙᾶνσὲΒ 286; yet Virgo,
238, 248.

501. suos . . . sensus: i. e. ea quae ipse sentit, sua consilia; and
so sensus is used in good prose. Libra hears himselt'3 see n. on 485.
sensus uocat laic auditus, Scaliger, incorrectly, Ι think3 yet for sensus
= auditus we might, conceivably, compare Culex 10 ut tz‘bz· digna tuo

¹ ultra ‘ just the other side os Aries' guarantees us against such changes as
Emssgronen uidet in 488.
