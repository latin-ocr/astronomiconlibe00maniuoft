THE THREE PRINCIPAL MSS.

And now we can see at once both how much and how little
justice there is in Thielscher’s onslaught upon G. G, in so far
as it is a descendant of a, is, as Thielscher accounts it, a good
deal inferior to L. L is the sincerer‚ less interpolated, represen-
tative of α. G is in itself an inferior L 3 but it is an inferior L
which has been worked through (or its parent had, more probably)
by a fool with a better MS. of Manilius than the world will ever
see again—till Herculaneum gives up its dead. I say a ‘fool’
worked through G with such a MS.; for the sparsity of the
corrections which he has introduced from it argues an extreme
tenuity of intelligence. Yet we owe this fool‚ even so, a deep
debt. If it is levity to say with Housman that G and M are
‘ equal ⁷, it is equal levity to say with Thielscher that G is a MS.
which may be altogether set aside. This much, however, we may
say: G's blunders deserve no attention. ΑΓΕ blunders are
infinitely important. Its strangest corruptions are again and again
nearer the truth than the specious correctness of the other MSS.
But G where it is wrong is useless. When its readings give
sense we have, if they differ materially from those of M, to con-
sider whether their appearance of correctness is the result of
ξ interpolation or of ‘correction’ in the true sense. But the examples
of true correction from a pure and ancient source are so many
that G remains an indispensable guide in the construction of any
sane text. I may sum up the relative merits of G and M by
saying that they are two MSS„ of which the one, M, is good all
through and bad all through, the other, G, is bad all through
but good in places.

Ι will not pursue examples of the same phenomenon through the other
books. Nor must Ι be supposed to think that these or other examples prove
that G is not derived from L. They prove nothing, but, in conjunction with
other facts, they materially weaken the presumption of G's dependence
upon L (which is, aster all, a mere presumption). It is particularly difficult
to conceive how G, which, according to Thielscher, contains so many true
readings reached by conjecture, should so osten reject the true readings
offered to it by the corrector os its original. Nor can 1 explain, upon Thiel-
scher's hypothesis‚the number of places where GM agree against L : e. g. in

111. 1-400 alone, at 3, 45, 70, 73, 213, 2:335, 265, 295, 333, 360, 367, 377, 387.
