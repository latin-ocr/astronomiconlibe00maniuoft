COMMENTARY πει-5

281. The second triangle is Virgo, Taurus, Capricorn.

282-3. cetera: the third triangle is Gemini, Aquarius, Libra; the
fourth, Cancer, Pisces, Scorpion.

Manilius seems to have in mind (though he starts from a line
drawn by nature, cf. on 274) a kind of triangular frame upon a pivot‚
and by means of this pivot the frame is made to revolve round the
Zodiac-the apex of the triangle‚ which originally rested on the first
point of Aries, being shifted round so as to rest on the first point of
each of the three succeeding signs in order. The second triangle is
arrived at by transferring the apex to the first point os Taurus, the
third by moving it to the first of Gemini, the fourth by shifting it to
the first point of Cancer. λόγῳ μέν Manilius is describing the Zodiacal
Circle, ἔργῳ δέ the astrological instruments of his day. That such
instruments were objects quite familiar to the ordinary Roman of the
time is clear from Prop. iv. 1. 7 5-6 uates nescius aerata szgrna mouere
pila (see Hertzberg’s note) ; cf. Cic. de Rep. i. 14, and the description
(quoted in Mai ad loc. p. 43) by Lactantius of Archimedes' sphere
(concavo aere similitudinem mundi ac figuram potuit machinari). For
some account os astrological instruments in antiquity generally cf.
Martin in Daremberg et Saglio's dictionary, vol. i, pp.486 sqq. Other
references, Bouche-Leclercq‚ 265, n. 1. Notable are Ovid Ep. xxv,

eff Zoa'iacs and Plam‘spheres, London‚ 1904.

283. per totidem sortes distant quae: separated by the same
number of degrees; i. e. by the number of degrees equal to three
signs (278 ternis ugnas).

The MSS. offer per totidem tortis desunt (dest M) que.
Bonincontrius interprets desunt quae as quae non expressimus
nominatim; so F. Junius, ⁴1& λοιπά’; and so, too, better editors.
Ihave received what seems to me on the whole the most likely
conjecture. [We should perhaps write sortis] Bentley, followed by
Pingre and Breiter, athetises everything from distant (desunt) to 287
exemplo est. Yet, save t'nat in 284 seu causa has not been
satisfactorily corrected, 1 know of no objection that has been brought
against 284-7 beyond the false one that they make 293 tautologous.
There is no tautology. In 284—7 Manilius merely says that it makes
a difference whether triangular signs are right or left. (A sign on the
right of an allied triangular sign is superior to one which is on the left
of the third sign.) Right signs are those quae praecedunt ; lest those
quae subeunt. In 293 he has passed to quadrangular signs, and
speaking of Libra as ‘left’ he adds ‘semper enim dextris censentur
signa priora,’ i.e. the rule priora = dextra holds good always, and
not merely for the signs of a triangle. lndeed 293 is in itself
a complete confutation of Bentley, for it is meaningless to any reader
who has not got 283—7 before him. In addition to this the text
receives confirmation from Firmicus II. xxii. 4-6 Dextrum trigonum est
quod ab eo signo a quo incipimus retro est, sinistrum uero quod abante
(ξ 4= Man. 284-6) . . . sed quod sit quadratum dextrum, quod sinistrum,
simili ratione sicut in tngonis diximus inuenies (§ 6 = Man. 293).

284. †seu causa†: M has seu eusa, which points possibly to
si censa—‘ it makes a difference if the signs belong to the class os
right signs ’ ; and the words which follow explain what right and left
signs are. Housman’s scaenisque is palaeographically poor, nor is the
word Manilian. Ellis' ceu causa I do not understand.

285. subeunt: i. q. sequuntur.
