COMMENTARY 153—62

right ς cs. ν. 140 Taurus in auersos praeceps cum tollitur ortus-where,
sor ortus, Bentley writes artus.

154. in orbem: right round the Zodiacal Circle.

155. The humanae species are Gemini, Virgo, Libra, Aquarius.

in parte = in aliis, as pars (156) = alii.

156. neo mores distant: sc. ab humanis moribus3 he means the
mores which they give to men; as appears from the converse ingenium
facient in 1 7.

157. quagdam: Ι have adopted Bentley's correction of the MSS.
quae iam. singula quaedam will then be such signs as are not
treated in 159—95, viz. Aries, Taurus, Cancer, Leo, Scorpion, Libra,
A uarius.

q If quae iam be retained, as Breiter, e.g., retains—though he does
not explain— it, the construction can only be : ea quae iam sagaci animo
signanda sunt singula sunt, ea scilicet quae propria sorte feruntur-
‘the signs which you have at this moment (at once, opp. to nunc
“passing on '') to note carefully are single ones, those, namely, which
as they move in heaven have individua} properties and influences.'
For the order of the words in the Latin see i. 58-9 postquam omnis
caeli species, redeuntibus astris, percepta, in proprias sedes; with
Housman’s note ad loc. Add Ovid Fast. iii. 675—6 nunc mihi, cur
cantent, superest, obscena puellae, dicere ; Ibis 246 filla canet uates qui
tua, dzlril, erit; Met. xiii. 784 sumptaque harundinibus compacta est
fistula centum (where est belongs to sumptaque): Hor. S. i. 1. 33
paruola, nam exemplo est magni, formica, laboris . . . English poetry is
sometimes capable of equally violent transpositions‚as,e.g., in Marvell’s
Horatian Ode ll. 7-8 ‘Removing from the wall, The corslet, of the

’ hall ⁹—lines which editors, not perceiving the pseudo-classicism, have

conspired to punctuate in such a way as to make nonsense of thern.

Ι can find no other way of interpreting an unaltered text, unless we
are to suppose (and Ι do not see how we can suppose) that singula
and bina are not antithetical here ; unless we are to suppose, that is,
that singula = each one, each of the twelve signs, and that propria
sorte distinguishes the influence of each sign in isolation from its
influence when in conjunction with some other sign or signs; that
propria sorte is opposed not to binis but to consensu et foedere (271)
whether of trigona or quadrata, &c.

159-96. bina signa. Of these there are three classes: (1) signa
paria, ξὺζυγα, Gemini, Pisces, 161—8; (2) signa biformia, διφυῆ,
Capricorn, Sagittarius, 169—73; (3) signa ratione duplicia, διπλᾶ,
Gemini, Sagittarius, Pisces, Virgo, 174—95.

159—60. geminata per socium together, as Germ. Arat. 548 per
Chelas geminato lumine fulgens.

161. quis sunt collegia: quibus sunt collegia duorum corporum.-
tanquam Gemini sint collegae inter se et Pisces, Scaliger.

161-2. ualent satis ambiguis ad meritum noxamque .· fatis is abl. of
the sphere within which ; V. 28 ualeant ortu.

162. per sidera: below 488 uidet atque audit per sidera Pisces;
where per sidera clearly means ‘across the intervening signs’. So
perhaps here too: ‘behold, gazing across the signs between, the
Fishes ’ς the ‘signs between ' will be those between Aries and Pisces,
Aries being always the natural starting-point for a survey of the Zodiac.
Yet at 922, iv. 443 per sidera = inter sidera, or nearly so, as Verg.
Georg. i. 2383 and it may mean so here. At iv. 238 per sidera is
different—‘ in sidereal form ⁸.
