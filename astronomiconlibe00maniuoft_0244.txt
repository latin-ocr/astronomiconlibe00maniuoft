11 730—6 COMMENTARY

your 120, suas parles = 10 degrees (this would require aequam partem
ei parti quam lam habety: he thus has 20 degrees, though you have
only given him 10 of your 1203 give him another 10: he thus has
30 and you are left with 100. This interpretation is, of course,
impossible as a rendering of the Latin, and leads us to a false result at
735. Ι notice it in order to point out to any one who still believes in
732—4 that the false result at 735 would be avoided by excising‚ or
emending, the word reliquis in 734 (segnis will then be Aries and the
signs follo)wing; and the method will involve doing the same sum
thce over .

Mr. A. L. Dixon has suggested to me ‘quaeue hinc desuerz‘nt’
(defuerint iam codd. dett..) He then understands ⁴ Give to the sign

‚its own 3(0) degrees, or any number less than thirty which xx 12
may yield you! The words quaeue ltine defnermt are, he thinks, put
in to provide sor cases where the moon is in the first or second degree
of a sign—i. e. in the dodecatemory of the sign in which it stands.
My principal doubt here is whether quae defiterznt can bear the
meaning suggested.

Ellis’ quae et dehinc dsuerant is open to the same objections as
Bentley' 5 emendation. But his note is valuable for the parallel which
it cites from the so· -called Δημοκρίτου σφαῖρα (Dieterich‚ p. 813);
συμψὴφισον τὴν σελήνην, καὶ βλεπε πόσαι τριακάδες γίνονται καὶ τὰ
περιλειπόμενα τοῦ ἀριθμοῦ.

suas as = xxx, the text gives the required sense without the additional
words. See further upon 736-7.

this correction was not made earlier, when editors had no better
interpretation to offer of le iustum than Bonincontrius' luna uidebit te

Breiter takes astra as :pl117zel1152 ‘aher Luna fiihrt mit sich
die fimf Planeten—czstra hier Planeten‚ denn Luna kann nur Planeten

astra. So Coeech, ‘ the following planets lie in following twelfths and
there enjoy the sky '; and so Du Fay. But the other planets have
nothing to do here. The moon has been taken exempli causa3 any

Bouche- -Leclercq charges Manilius' in this passage with two gross
blunders: (1) He imagines him at 726—31 and 732— 4 to be versifying
two distinct methods given in his source under the impression that
together they constituted a single method. Bouche-Leclercq is
throughout his book very unfair to Manilius, and this particular charge
arises from a defect in his work which is everywhere apparent—he has
not read, or not reid with care, Bentley. (2) He says that Manilius,
when he contemplates the c>case of a planet standing in some other
degree than the first (e. g. 5 ⁰,) throws his calculations into confusion by
beginning the distribution mentioned· in 729—31 at the first and not the
fifth degree of the sign in which the planet stands. This error is, as
he says justly chargeable to Firmicus. But I am not clear, in the
uncertain condition of our text, that it is chargeable to Manilius, and
