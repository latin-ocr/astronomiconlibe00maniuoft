INTRODUCTION III

when he says that the editor of the Bononiensis cannot have seen
the work of Regiomontanus. Yet the basis of the two texts is
the same, and I suspect that there is nothing which they lzave in
common which is not in the Laurentianus. I should conjecture
that the Bologna editor actually had the Florentine MS. before
him, and that Regiomontanus employed a Hungarian brother of
it: that Regiomontanus used one MS. and (sparingly) his wits,
and the Bologna editor more than one MS. but not his wits—
or they were poor wits. The ed. Bononiensis is assigned by
Muratori loc. cit. to Bonincontrius, and this attribution may be
found also in Fabricius. It is first called in question, so far
as Ι know, by Saxius in his Onomasticolz Litterarizmz, ii, pp. 457-8.
Manilian scholars have, however, one and all rejected the opinion
of Muratori and embraced that of Saxius. On what grounds
they have done this Ι have no means of discovering 3 nor am
I competent to treat the question. Ι would, however, offer two
observations: (1) Muratori was acquainted with relatives of
Bonincontrius, and had access to Bonincontrius' papers. He
was, therefore, in a position to know. (2) It seems to me likely
that Scaliger attributed the ed. Bononiensis to Bonincontrius,
when, in his first edition,1 he wrote ‘aiunt Bonincontrium quendam
in hunc poetam commentarios edidisse . . . quid ipse in hunc
poetam boni edere potuerit non uideo qui tot mendis inquinatum
eum nobis reliquerit': and he goes on to say that if he had the
Commentary before him he would probably find that the monstrous
faults of the Manilian vulgate were the product of Bonincontrius'
inventive faculty. I can find no meaning in all this unless Scaliger
regarded some one or other of the printed texts (prior to 1484)
as the work of Bonincontrius. (3) The text of Bonincontrius’
edition is in the main that of ed. Bononiensis, distinguished
from it only by its greater wealth of conjecture. For the fifteenth-
century editions, like the MSS, of Manilius fall into two distinct
falnilies, which Ι have distinguished² as e and ε. e consists of
Regiomontanus, the first Naples edition (1475), the edition in
quarto ³ sine loco et amm, and the second4 Naples edition (147 5-

¹ Comment., p. 4. ² See pp. 155 sqq.

²³ The solio edition sine loco et anno is the rarest of all the editions os
Manilius—there exists perhaps only one copy, and there is no repert of its
readings which would help us to classify it.
