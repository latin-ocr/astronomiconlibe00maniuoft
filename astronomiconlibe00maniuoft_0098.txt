'Pingre’s‘texu translation, and notes (1786) have long enjoyed an
enviable position. This editor alone among editors of Manilius
seems to be hated by no one. How this has come about I do not
know. I suppose that Pingre' fell upon what in the world of
scholarship were quiet times. He was a competent man who had
no one more competent ready to rap him over the knuckles for
his mistakes, and as he set out modestly to be useful he did not
offend, as did Scaliger and Bentley, men of inferior abilities to his
own. His notes are few and brief and good. His text may be
described as Bentley and water. His translation (somewhat like
Poste’s translations of Aristotle) leaves always the impression that
the translator has understood his author, while how and why he
has come to do so remains a mystery. On a difficult construction
Pingre's rendering throws no light. Occasionally he corrects
Du Fay, and indeed he worked with a better text. Sometimes he
lapses into mistakes which Du Fay had avoided.

Jacob's text (1846) has been for half a century the text in which
Manilius has been commonly read. It will now undoubtedly be
superseded by Breiter, and justly. The text itself is barely read-
able, but until Bechert it was the only one furnished with an
Apparatus Criticus of any value. In addition to recording the
MS. variants Jacob recorded also the variants of the edition of
Molinius, thereby giving the reader a fair notion of the text of
Manilius as it was before Scaliger took it in hand. Occasionally
also in his Apparatus he ventured on interpretations of difficult
passages,- and here, even when he is wrong, he is often useful.
The Appendix of diagrams which concludes the volume is also of
considerable service,² so too the Index. It is not difficult to see,
therefore, why Jacob has so long held so strong a position. Nor
is he without higher merits. In his Liibeck programme he showed
considerable penetration in explaining the transpositions detected

¹ Jacob's judgement upon Stoeber is amusing and forcible: ‘Ingenium
antem eius hominis Terentius describit ’ (Heaut. Tim. v. 1. 4),
quae sunt dicta in stulto, caudex, stipes, asinus, plumbeus,
in illum nil potest: exsuperat eius stultitia haec omnia.
‘Yetf' he adds, ‘inuenti sunt qui eum sequi mallent quam Scaligeros atque
Bentleios‚' De Manilio Poeta, p. 2, b.
