INTRODUCTION ΙΙΙ

him. Yet he must, I fancy, have taken from him without acknow-
ledgement the brilliant and certain correction Pallas at II. 2 1 (vide
ad loa). I daresay he owes to Creech a good deal more, but I have
not read Creech’s version with any care save for Book ΙΙ. As a
translator Creech is, in the smoother passages of Manilius, grace-
ful and lively. Ι have quoted him occasionally in my Commentary‚
and he will I think be admitted to merit such occasional citation.
When he has to do with ‘trines' and ‘quadrates ' and ‘ twelfths‘
he might well be expected to be, and indeed is, unreadable. His
renderings are never close, and there is a wosul amount of
‘padding ’. The following, from the exordium to Book II, gives
a fair idea of his merits and defects :

The mighty Bard in lasting numbers sings
Ilium's long wars, the King of fifty kings,

Brave Hector's brand, the bloody dreadful field,
And Troy secure behind the hero's shield:

He sings Ulysses and his wandering years

In time and glory equal to his wars:

He sings how twice he conquering ploughed the main,
Whilst Scylla roared and Neptune raged in vain,
And how at home he fixed his tottering throne,
Redeemed his honour and secured his son:
Usurping woers felt his thundering sword,

And willing nations knew their native lord.

It must be remembered that this is more than twenty years
prior to Pope's Iliad.

Creech's long Preface on the date and name of Manilius, and
on the Stoic philosophy, is perhaps not worth reading to-day.
But much is still written upon the same subjects which is no
better.

From Creech we pass to the ‘ very learned gentleman’ whose
‘ observations ² Creech desired to see. Bentley's edition, prepared
for the press, prefaced‚ and published by his nephew in 1739, has
always been sufficiently praised, and has for the most part deserved
the praise accorded to it. Mr. Housman, it is true, speaks as
though he had discovered this book by accident on a neglected
shels in the British Museum, and was the first person to become
aware of its merits. But this is not so. Bentley's edition
with its transcendent merits has long been known and appre-
ciated.¹ Indeed, its virtues are so obvious and outstanding that
