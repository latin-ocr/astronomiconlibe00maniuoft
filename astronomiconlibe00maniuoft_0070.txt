INTRODUCTION 111

the Sullan period that there came to Rome Manilius Antiochus—-
to us a mere name, but undoubtedly a personality of wide in-
fluence, for Pliny¹ speaks of him as ‘conditor astrologiae '. But
much more important, a generation later, was the advent os
Posidonius. A pupil of Panaetius, Posidonius came to Rome
in 51 B. c.-—his influence waS, of course, felt there much earlier.
St. Augustine² speaks of him as ‘fatalium siderum assertor’ 3 and
if Panaetius had done anything to arrest the vogue of astrology,
Posidonius more than redressed the balance. He left an influence
powerfully operative a century after his death. To him was due
the final victory of the Stoicism of the Principate over the fashion-
able Epicureanism of the Republican period—a triumph which
was at the same time the triumph of astrology. Other conditions
also favoured the astrologer. Manilius, in the Exordium to the
fourth book, describes Julius Caesar as holding in his hand, and
staining with his lifeblood‚ as he fell, the document which
contained the prediction of his death:

totiens praedicta cauere
uulnera non potuit toto spectante senatu
indicium dextra retinens nomenque³ cruore
deleuit proprio, possent ut uincere fata.

Astrology is the natural ally of hereditary power. On the day
upon which Augustus was born, Nigidigs Figulus,⁴ an astrologer
and a prominent senator, predicted in the senate his future great-
mess—dominum terrarum orbi natum. Augustus' own interest in
astrology is sufficiently attested even by such gossip as Suetonius’
story of his adventure with Theagenes.5 That he used the
astrologers to his own ends is, perhaps, true. On the other
hand, astrology was by this time one of the recognized ἐπιστῆμαι.
It had for its patrons men of learning such as Nigidius⁶ and
Varro,7 and it uas responding to the kindly influences that had
