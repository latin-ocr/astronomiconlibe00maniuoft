MANlLlUS AND HIS EDITORS

‘ Post illum (Scaligerum) quievit Manilius usque ad Richardum
Bentleium‚' says Jacob} But this is to go too fast. Scaliger’s
first edition appeared in 1579. Nearly a hundred years later²
there was published in London (1675 : Mr. Housman says 1674,
but my copy is dated 1675) Edward Sherburne⁷s translation of,
and commentary upon, Book Ι. It is surprising how many of the
countrymen of Newton have pleased themselves with Manilius,
and if only as the first of them Sherburne deserves gratitude.
But he deserves gratitude on other grounds also. His translation
(which is in heroic verse) is not good, but it is not bad. As verse
it has a good many of the merits of the verse of the time. As a
rendering of Manilius it is pretty honest, not freer than Pingre and
not much less accurate. But it is the notes to this translation
which chiefly deserve praise. Of the Latin text Sherburne has
nothing to say,3 but around his English rendering of it he has
massed a vast collection of illustrative and explanatory matter,
drawn from all sources. He is, in fact, in this department the

‘Manilium tuum edi sama ad nos peruenit.' This seems to be Casaubon's
way of asking for a copy. Scaliger writes to him, sending Manilius, on
xii Kal. Oct. 1599: Epist„ L. B., 1627, p. 177. (Casaubon’s answer to this
letter, xvi Kal. Mart. 1600, may be seen in Epist„ 1656, p. 223.) Earlier,
on September 30, 1599. Scaliger had sent Manilius to Lipsius: Burmann,
Sylloge, i, no. 239, p. 242. On November 29, 1599, Monanthveil writes to
thank Scaliger for a copy os Manilius (Epistres ἀ M. de la Scala, p. 1372:
and a similar letter of thanks from Rigault (ἰὰ, p. 491) is dated November 30
of the same year.

It appears that of Scaliger's casalata, ed. 1, some copies bear the date
1572, some 1573: cf. Manuel du Libraire, i, col. 1639. Perhaps, therefore.
os both this and of the Manilius there were issued a certain number of
‘advance copies' for friends, &o The same may have happened with the
Festus: see on this Bernays, Scaliger, p. 279.

¹ De Manilio Poeta, p. 3, note.

³ Between Scaliger and Sherburne lie Gronovius (whom Sherburne had
studied‘: and Barthius. Gronovius’ notes are to be found partly in the
Observationum Libri Tres, partly in his Letters in Burmann's Sylloge, and
partlyin the Dt'aln‘be in Statisiluas. Upon Book 11 he oflers not more than
half a dozen emendations, of which one (pestisque, 228) is certain, one
(umbrato, 139) is plausible, the rest have little merit. Barthius’ conjectures
are given in his Aduersart'a3 but the Indices to this work are so unillu-
minating that I made very scant researches in it. It is a pity that
N. Heinsius never turned his serious attention to Manilius. 1 can nowhere
find more than seven suggestions os his upon Manilius, os which only one-
⁶ struxisset (or status'ssel) ouilia monte‚’ IV. 28—is worth quoting.

³ He contemphted, however, an edition, and had employed both G and
the Codex Pithoei: Bentley, Lelleis, p. 37.
