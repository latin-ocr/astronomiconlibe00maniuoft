NOTE ON THE MADRID MS.

the transcribet of his Constance MS.-—‘ignorantissimus omnium
uiuentium ’. And Poggio’s characterization of the work of this
eguerantzksimus exactly corresponds with our experience of svs:
‘diuinare oportet, non 1egere.’

Here I reach the difficulty which it was the first object of this
Note to posit. Since the titulus of M is found to date from the
sixteenth century, what grounds have we for connecting M with
Poggio at all? We have no means of knowing that M and the
certainly Poggian P were conjoined before saec. xvi 3 and their
conjunction has always been regarded as the most important
evidence for the Poggian origin of M.¹

To attempt here a solution of this difficulty would carry me far
beyond the limits which I have set myself. I will only say that
Ι am not sure that the best witness to the Poggian origin of M
will not in the end prove to be Politian. But the very name of
Politian in this connexion carries with it the noise of a controversy
which Ι desire to avoid.² I pass to the second of the objects with
which this Note is written.

In M foll. 1—54r are occupied by Manilius, foll. 54 v—59v are
left blank, for the very apparent reason that they are the last
eleven pages of a senio³t the scribe’s material gave out on the
first page of the senio, and the other pages, as often happens, were
left blank. 59 v is soiled ; so that it would seem, Thielscher says,
that Manilius formed one codex before it was added to Statius.
’ As a matter of fact, the soiled condition of 59 v does not show that
Manilius was once a codex by itself. If it had been it would have
been bound, and the soiling would not have come about. The
soiling merely shows that Manilius was written before Statius, and
left lying about unbound while Statius was in progress. (Poggio
more than once in his letters is bothered by the problem of how
many authors, or works, or uolumina, he is going to conjoin in one
codex.) The Manilius seniones, then, end at 59 v. We should

1 It is, 1 think, a prtori very unlikely that Poggio himself ever conjoined
P and M. They are written on different paper (the watermark is different:
Thielscher, p. 89), and Poggio seems always to have been anxious that
a single volume should be written throughout on the same paper (Epa,
Tonelli, pp. 150, 153, 165, 187. 286, 328). The fact also that the one is
in Poggio's own hand, the other in that of a scriba indoctus tells against the
view that Poggio conjoined the two MSS.

² For the benefit of those interested in this controversy 1 would mention
here (what 1 have not seen mentioned elsewhere) that Politian⁷s collation
of M(if M it was) in the Corsini copy of the siluae was already known to
J. Wouvver in 1600. In March of that year Scaliger writes to Wouvver=
‘In diem expecto quae Politianus olim Syluarum margini ex uetustissimo
codice annotarat. Ea multum editionem tuam exornabunt‚⁷ Epzst„ L. Β.,
1627, p. 717.

³ 1 know no mention, 1 may say in passing, in Poggio's letters of the use os
seniones. 1 recall several mentions of quaternions and one of quinternions.
