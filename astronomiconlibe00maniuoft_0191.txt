COMMENTARY 176-88

have duo cmpora. It would seem that in 660 sqq. duplici conexa
figura . . . duplicem formam . . . duo corpora are used loosely as
rough synonyms for bina (mm) signa (acm) merely.

On the whole we may conclude that Manilius habitually regarded
Virgo, despite the wings, as simplex = necfacie ( forma) duplex essen-
tiassy, and as only duplex by accident-the accident of position. This
is, 1 feel sure, a truer view than that of Ellis, who holds that nec facie,
&c., is equivalent merely to ‘ non tarn fizcz'e quam ex duplici tempore
cui praeest aestatis et autumni’, ‘double not so much by her form as
by her position ’. For why (see above) should ratio count for more in
the case of Virgo than in that of Sagittarius? [See, however, Boll
sphaera, p. 513, Aba zlla‘sar, ch. vi with note 5.]

Bouche-Leclercq rightly points out (p. 151) that Manilius has
throughout this passage embarrassed himself with the conflicting·
claims of geometry and mythology. Ratio demands that the signs
preceding the tropic signs should be duplicia, since by their position
duplices retinent in corpora uires. And this demand happens to be
satisfied mythologically in the case of all of them save Virgo. But
Bouche-Leclercq is clearly in error when he says that with ‘ un peu plus
cle savoir-faire’ Manilius might have got rid of the difficulty as to
Virgo by supposing that constellation ‘double ' as being composed of
Virgo and Spica. Virgo and Spica could not be regarded as, in any
sort, paria corpora, as e. g. the twin fishes are; nor again as a szssgrnum
διφυές, since the Spica is obviously not a part of Virgo’s corpus, as
the horse is a part of the corpus of Sagittarius.

178-80. idcirco . . . quod: together.

182. ex Geminis: Bitterauf Observationes, pp. 20-1, points out that
Manilius is never consistent in his usage of esc, e; thus we have ii. 395
ex partibus; iv. 593 e partibus; ii. 484 ex szjgnis3 i. 285 e solido. The
fact, therefore, that at iv, 152 we have e geminis cannot be used here
(though Bitterauf uses it) as an argument against Ellis' ex, which
explains at once the e (an easy emendation) of Λ] and the et of GL.
Similarly at 370 we should read probably ex totidem (cf. iv. 91 ex tecto)
despite iii. 375 e toto.

182. Cf. Lucr. vi. 359 tempora . . . ueris-florentia.

184. nudus: so Ovid Met. ii. 28 nuda aestas.

186. par est primae sors ultima parti: gives the reason why
sentit uterque calorem (184) ; the end os spring, sors ultima, is as hot,
par est, as the early part of summer, primae parti.

parti: non uideo cur parti deneges Manilio, sorti polius scribas .·
nihil z'nterest utrum elzjgas .· uocabula uariauit, non rem, Ellis; and it
is true that Manilius uses pars and sors indifferently3 see Book ΙΙΙ
passim, e. g. 38 5 sqq. But sorti, though I have not ventured to print
it, seems to me more elegant and Manilian here than parti.

187-8. Arquitenens: for the spelling cf. Verg. Aen. iii. 75 ; Naevius
Fragm. 32, 43 Baehr.

sub ipso promittit : Capricornum post se oriturum pro-
mittit, Bentley, and so Pingre. For sub ipso =p0st se, Bentley
compares Verg. Aen. v. 32 3-4 quo deinde sub ipso ecce uolat. But to be
running (= uolat) rzgrlzt up under some one is intelligible; to pro-
mise some one rzjght up under onesels seems to me not so. ‘Verheisst
in seinem Lause den Winter,’ Breiter‚ with what one might think inten-
tional obscurity. ‘ Under his own form he gives the forecast of
Capricorn,' Ellis (because, Ι suppose, both he and Capricorn are szgrna
διφυῆ) ; but Manilius is not here concerned with the fact that Capricorn
