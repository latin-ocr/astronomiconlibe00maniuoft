MANILIUS AND HIS EDITORS

the scornsul epigram which he hurls at astrologers and their
persecutors—‘genus hominum potentibus infidum, sperantibus
fallax, quod in ciuitate nostra et uetabitur semper et retinebitur.'
This will be a suitable place for saying something of the
fortunes of astrology generally in the Roman world, and of the
repnte, in different periods, of its practitioners. Astrology found
its way to the West along the route of Alexander’s conquests.
(The eontention that Plato, at an earlier date, shows some know-
ledge of its principles is at least doubtful 3 and in any case as
a recognized profession astrology is first found in Greece about
the beginning of the third century.) It came to Rome from
Greece as a part of the great Hellenizing movement which
followed upon the Hannibalian War. By the beginning of the
second century it was already enjoying there a considerable
vogue. The great adversary of the invading Hellenism of this
period, M. Porcius Cat0,¹ thought it necessary to forbid his
uilicus all resort to haruspicem, augurem, hariolum Chaldaeum.
In 139 B. C. the Praetor Peregrinus, Cn. Cornelius Hispalus,
expelled from Italy by edict all astrologers.² But the time for
such edicts was already passed. Astrology had found in the
‘Stoic philosophy an ally more powerful than any magisterial
power. Cicero3 tells us that the great Stoic philosopher
Panagtius (who died about 111 ac.) considered that, save for
two bf his friends, he was alone among the Stoics in rejecting the
claim of astrology to be a science. His chief contemporaries—
Anghialus, Cassaptder, Scylax—were all believers, and the in-
fluenceof Panaetius was aspowerless as the edict of Hispalus to
keep out of Rome either the theory or the practice of astrology.
Plutarch⁴ tells us that when Cn. Octavius was killed by the
Marians there was found upon his body a διάγραμμα Χαλδαίων.
And the long period of the revolution from the Gracchi to
Caesar—promoting as it did by its frequent and sudden
‘reversals of fortune' the belief in an ungovernable destiny,
a saith in the ‘star' of individual great men—found for the
astrologer frIends among the politicians. We read of ‘oracles'
given to Gracchus, Sulla, Pompey, Crassus, Caesar. It was in
