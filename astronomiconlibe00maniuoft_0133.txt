ASTRONOMICON 11

occasion calls, according as the stars in heaven proclaim
now wrath, now amity. If you desire to recount the
names and positions of the opposed signs, then remember
to range the summer solstice over against the winter,
Capricorn against the Crab‚ the Ram against the Balance
—in these two night and day are equal—Erigone against
the Fishes‚ the Lion against the Lad with the Urn. When
the Scorpion shines from the height of heaven, the Bull is
in the depth. The Archer sinks as the Twins rise to their
place in the Circle. [These are the motions which the
contrary signs conserve among themselves] Yet though
they shine with ensigns opposed, yet ever and anon they
are borne along in alliance because of a natural tie of sex ;
a harmony of spirit comes to them in so far as male acts in
concert with its like, or female again with those of its own
sex. The Fishes ancl the stars of the Maid move in their
swift ssight with opposed fronts: yet they have rights in
common which they cher-ish, and the tie of nature is stronger
than that of place. Yet even this tie is broken by con-
sideration of seasons Cancer is at strife, Capricorn, with
thee, female sign with female, for the reason that summer
and winter are sworn foes : from Capricorn comes cold and
· ice and a snow-whitened countryside; from Cancer thirst
and sweat, and a world all dry and bare under the hot
suns ; and the cold winter night is as long as the summer
day. Thus does nature make war, and thus is the year at
strife: nor need you marvel if stars so situate in heaven
contend together. But the signs of the Ram and the
Balance are not—because autumn and spring differ, because
spring fills the earth with flowers, autumn with fruits—-they
are not on that account utterly at variance, but they are at
unison in the principle of their being, which is that each
makes the night equal to the day : and the like texture of
their two seasons and their mildly compounded tempera-
ture, lying as they do at points midway between summer
and winter, and so preserving both seasons in their own
season,—all this brings it about that these two signs do not
contend in fierce war. [Such will be the principle assigned
for the relations of different stars.]
