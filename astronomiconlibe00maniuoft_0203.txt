COMMENTARY 290-322

triangular and quadrangular associafflon, before explaining adequately
what quadrangular association is, carries confusion.

290—5. The first square is Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn3 the
sSecoigtd, Tanau-s, Aquanus, Scorpion, Leo; the third, Gemini, Pisces,

a 1 arius ιτ ο.

2g91. hin’c: si> M ; hunc cett. hinc, in any case, is not due to
Bentley, since it is already given by Du Fay.

atq. ipsum a p. a. : cf. Verg3A en. ix. 7 54 atque illi partibus aequis.

297-357, The whole of this difficult and prolix passage is, strictly
speaking, unnecessary. Manilius has already said that the triangles
are equilateral (274), the quadrata squares (289). It follows therefore

from the first point of Aries to the last of Leo as the first lme of your

triangle, that triangle cannot have its three sides equal without going
outside the circumference of the Zodiac.

Before 297 GM have the lemma De mensura eorum signz‘lz'ter atque
partiliter. The schematism of signs signiliter (ζωδιακῶς) regarded the
sign as a unit, as itselfa point 3 the line passed from sign to sign. This
was the popular and ‘ unscientific ' method (ζωδισκὴ καὶ κοινὴ καὶ
καθολικὴ, καθ’ ἣν πάντες πλανώμεθα, ‘Demophilus'). The exacter method
was a schematism partiliter (μοιρικῶς), in which the line passed from
a given degree (pars, sors, μοῖρα) in one sign to the corresponding
degree in the other. For a third method‚ aiming at real exactitude,
the mensura χρονικῶς, introduced by Antigonus of Nicaea, see Bouche-
Leclercq, pp. 178—9.

299. The construction seems to be aut (ut putet) tria (signa) sub

” quinis signis ornare trigonum. This involves a slight illogicality,

since the ut putet refers back to contentus (ita) numerare quadrata,
‘content to reckon squares in such a way . . . as to suppose that . . .
makes a triangle ’.
tria sub quinis: tria, the signs at the apices of the triangle;
quinis, the signs on the arc subtended by one of the sides; see on
2873 cf. 313 ternis dirimentibus. tria sub quinis may, therefore,
Lnost conveniently be rendered by ‘ 3 signs separated from each other
Sl ns '.
y 30r÷1arez formare, Bentley3 but the signs which stand at the
apices of a triangle may appropriately be said to be its ‘ ornament '.

300. exigat, ‘ demand ‘, and so ‘expect ’.

302. undique : on each line of your triangle.

302-4. signa . . . signis . . . astra. The repetition is very harsh3
but here again, as so often, we must remember that we are dealing
with an unrevised poem. Perhaps in 304 trina (tria) for astra (Ura).

306. loco . . . numeris: geometrically and arithmetically.

322. †ter trigenta† quadrum. There are 360 degrees in the circle.
A quarter of these form the side of a square. The number required
therefore is 90; and the MSS. offer, indeed, 90, but in a form (ter
triginta) which involves a false quantity (Mueller R. M.‚ p. 341 (1861) ;
add Carm. Epigr. Buech. 387 duodetrzgintd quadragintd, 1255—6
quinquaginta, Auson. Ecl. Καί. Di„ Epp. v. 5 nonaginta, and many
other examples from the same collection.) Bentley's nongentae
(which involves a circle of 3600 degrees) is the rare lapse of a great
man. Jacob's conjecture ter quadra (plur.) triginta, which, it is true,
‘trifft das richtige' (Breiter‚ who prints it) has, on other grounds
little to recommend it. Postgate, writing ter quadra triginta . . .
