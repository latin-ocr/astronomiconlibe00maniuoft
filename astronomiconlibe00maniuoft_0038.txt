APPENDIX Ι

ΝΟΤΕ οΝ THE MADRm MS.

The object of this Note is twofold. I desire firstly to notice
a difficulty—to which proper attention has not, I think, been
called--in connexion with the received dogma of the Poggian
origin of M. Secondly, Ι wish to give prominence to a recent
and important discovery made by P. Thielscher in his examina-
tion of M.

M (or M 31, to give it its full title) has to be considered in
connexion with another MS. in the Madrid National Library,
X 81. M 31 contains the Siluae of Statius and the Astronomica
of Manilius. X 8] contains Valerius Flaccus, Asconius, and
Sigebert’s Clzmm’con. I will call M 31 by its usual designation M.
I will call X 81, so far as it contains Valerius and Asconius, P—
following Clark in his edition of Asconius. That portion of it
which contains the chronicon I will call π.

Clark regards Pas a transcript made by Poggio himself of the
MS. (or MSS.) of Valerius and Asconius which he unearthed at
St. Gall in 1416 (Epp.‚ Tonelli, pp. 25-9). π, again, he holds to
be Poggio’s copy, in his own hand, of a MS. of the Chronicon
which he found some years later in Britain. M, lastly, is, accord—
ing to Clark, a copy made for Poggio by a German scribe at
Constance of the MS. (or MSS.) of Statius⁷ siluae and Manilius
discovered in, or near, Constance about the same time as Valerius
and Asconius. It is, in fact, the very copy spoken of by Poggio
in his now well-known letter to F rancesco Barbaro.¹

It is supposed that M and P once formed a single MS. Both
have the same binding3 both bear the name of the same owner,
‘Del Sor Conde de Miranda'3 and the titulus to M runs thus:
‘Manilii Astronomica—Statii Papinii Siluae—Asconii Pediani in
Ciceronem-Valerii Flacci nonnulla.’ Through the last seven
words a line has been drawn (when the two MSS. were separated Ρ).
The titulus, it will be noticed, says not a word of Sigebert’s
Chronicon. Clark's view is that M and P were put together in
one volume while Poggio was in Germany or England: that
Poggio brought π back with him from England, and, disjoining
the previously united Mand P, added π to P.

Now this view is, Ι think, open at certain points to some rather
serious objections. Of these the most powerful is that the titulus
to Μ is written in a hand which cannot be earlier than the end
os the sixteenth century. Why no one has called attention to this
Ι do not know.² Klotz (Silvae, p. ix) calls the hand recentior
