INTRODUCTION 111

would be inexcusable in a Greek are not necessarily in a Roman suffi—
cient to sustain against him the charge of dilettantism. Moreover‚
many of the errors which we lay at the door of Manilius are pretty
certainly to be attributed to the badness of our MSS. Others
again are no doubt due to the circumstance that the Astronomica
has come down to us in an obviously unfinished condition.¹

The problem raised by the incomplete character of the poem
is a rather complex one, but I cannot here pass it by without
some discussion. It has been held that the poem is, as we have
it, incomplete because, as we have it, it is less than what Manilius
wrote: that a large portion of it, in fact, has been lost. In various
parts of his work Manilius makes promises which in the work, as
it has descended to us, are never fulfilled. In particular, he
promises repeatedly some account of the influences of the planets 3
and the Matlzesz's of Firmicus, who follows Manilius so closely, is
principally concerned with planetary astrology. The argument
from Firmicus must, I think, not be pressed: he had after all
other authorities than Manilius (however closely, in certain parts,
he follows Manilius ²). The strength of the hypothesis that a large
portion of the poem has been lost lies in the conjunction of two
facts. 'l'he first is that, as I say, Manilius promises a full treat-
ment of the ›usli-tura of planets and signs (cp. e. g. II. 749 sqq.) 3³
and the second, that in the opening lines of Book V (omitting
vv. 5—7) he speaks as though the actual scheme of his work
(save for the appendix which Book V constitutes) had already
reached completion. Do these facts admit of any other explana-
tion than that a large portion of the Astronome‘ca has been lost?
Ι fancy that they perhaps do. Ι am inclined to find the explana-
tion of them in the edict of A. υ. 16 of which I have already
spoken, That edict was directed against astrology as a practice-
able art. It was directed against astrology in so far as astrology
enables us to cast a horoscope. You can cast no horoscope if
you do not allow for the mixtura of planets and signs in their
influences. Consequently you cannot cast a horoscope by the

of Firmicus in Book VIII upon Manilius V.
