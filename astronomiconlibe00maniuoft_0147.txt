ASTRONOMICON II

Why speak of this? When crime sits in the very heart of
the people‚ and all things are filled with madness, right and
wrong are confounded utterly. Iniquity rages, employing
as its instruments the very laws themselves. Now has Guilt
outgrown Punishment. Know then clearly that because
men are born to warfare under many warring signs,—because
of this it is that peace upon earth has been done away, the
saith that binds is rare and vouchsafed but to a chosen few.
Even as the heaven, so also the earth is at strife within
itself, and the races of earth are subject to a discord in the
very lot of their nativity.

Nevertheless, if you are fain to know which of the signs
allied in a triangle are united together in spirit and friendly
disposed to one another, then bring together the Ram and
the other signs of his triangle. Yet is the Ram the simpler
creature, and kindly entreats the offspring of the Lion and
the Centaur beyond any return of love from them. For he
is by nature a gentle sign, open to the harm that falls on
gentleness, free of guile, and with heart as soft as the fleece
that wraps his body. But the Lion and Centaur are fierce
and rapine-loving, their mind is set on gain and impels
them ostentimes to transgress true friendship for advantage,

» nor do they retain gratitude for a service done. And those

born under either of these signs do not spare, but wage war
intermittently‚ as occasion demands, against the offspring
of the Ram: and this their fierce nature rather than any
injury they have received compels them to do. Yet more
strength must be accounted to reside in the double sign
that hath a mixture of man, than in thee, Nemean Lion, in
thy single form. Therefore is it that these signs are at
peace with one another, ancl yet mingle therewith wrangling.
Again, the sign of the Bull is allied to Capricorn: yet no
better do the spirits of these unite in bonds of friendship.
Those that are born under the Bull are fain to embrace the
offspring of the Maid also: yet oft do they wrangle. But
those who are born of the Claws and of the Twins, and of
the Water-carrier—of one heart are they, and the bonds of
good saith bind thern indissolubly, Fortunate are their
friendships, many their friends The Scorpion and the
Crab lead into brotherhood those born under them; and
the offspring of the Fishes are friendly to them; yet often
