INTRODUCTION III

savant et suggestif' of Ellis. Against the nineties Ι have recorded
impressions (apart from T homas' Notes) of four works. The first
of these is Kraemer's De Manili qui fertur Astronomisis (Maffiurg,
1890). Kraemer maintains‚ wrongly as Ι think, an Augustan date
for the whole of the Astrononuka} This dissertation is neither
so interesting nor so important as a much later publication by the
same writer, Ort mle& derAbfasszmg der Astronomzm des Manilius
(Frankfort, 1904). This latter dissertation is not only learned
and ingenious, but is distinguished by the breadth of its literary
interests. Kraemer is particularly happy in the manner in which
he brings out the essentially Roman character of Manilius³ genius.
The references to Germany (Ι. 896; ΙΙΙ. 633 ; IV. 692, 715, 794)
are genuinely Roman. Roman nationality comes out, again, in
the frequent passages where Manilius contrasts the Greek and
Latin languages (ΙΙ. 888, 897, 909, 916, 937, ΙΙΙ. 36 sqq, IV.
812, 8453 V. 645). Manilius, again, shows an [mter familiarity
with Latin literature, particularly contemporary literature. And,
finally, Manilius has a strong ‘Romisches Staatsbewusstsein’.
When he speaks (I. 7923 IV. 40, 48, 566, 599, 658 ff„ 778) os,
c. g., Hannibal, one might think that one was listening to Horace
or Livy (pp. 4—9). Kraemer has since published an entertaining
treatise, De locis quibusdam (μα’ [n Astromnm'con quae Manilii
feruntur esse libro primo arlant ab Housmam Brt'tatmormu uiro
doctissimo corruptis (Frankfort‚ 1906). This is reviewed by Klein—
gunther in D. L. Z„ 1906, Nov. 3. The compliments in this
review are returned by Kraemer in a review of Kleingiinther
in D. L. A, 1907, pp. 2976 sqq. For Kraemer’s pam-
phlet see also Stoecker in Berl. Phil. Il'oclz„ 1907, pp. 776-8.
Kraemer has lately‚ in Bursian's sahresbert'clzt, 1908, passed in
review the more recent contributions to Manilian study.
Bechert⁷s De ill. Manilio Λςίνοηοῃιίίθη Poeta appeared in thc
year following the first of Kraemer’s pamphlets (Leipzig, 1891).
On the date of the i-ilstrolmmica Bechert takes a view diametri-
cally opposed to that of Lachmann and Freier: holding with
Kraemer that the whole poem was written under Augustus. The
most valuable portion of his paper is the second chapter where
(again like Kraemer) Bechert emphasizes the very Roman cha-
racter of Manilius. T appertz’s De Cozez’lmctionmn usu apud Alani—
lt'lmz (Munster‚ 1892), noticed by Ellis in C. R. viii, p. 213, is
¹ Book 1 was written in A.D.10.11i1111. III in 12, IV in 13, Vin 14.
