COMMENTARY 509

Consonant with this passage of Suetonius is Vergil Georg. i. 32-5,
which, though it does not in any way prove that Augustus was born
under Libra, is yet most naturally to be interpreted in that sense.

Suetonius, however, is not consistent. In Aug. 94 act sin. he
speaks of a silver coin which Augustus stamped nota sideris Capri-
corni, quo natus est. But if Augustus was born on Sept. 22 under
Capricorn, he must have been born not ‘a little before’, but some
four and a half hours after, sunrise.

Now about the date, Sept. 22, it seems unlikely that Suetonius
should be wrong. For the same date is given in Gellius xv. 7. 9, and
Suetonius himself in A ug. 31 has, consistently with Aug. 5,
Septembrem quo natus emt. On the other hand, Suet. Aug. 94, in
conjunction with this passage of Manilius and with Germ. Arat.
558—60 (laic, Auguste, tuum genitali corpore numen . . . in caelum tulit
et maternis reddidit asum—and finally the coincidence between these
three passages and the fact that numerous coins have come down to
us bearing the head of Augustus and the nota Capricorni—make it
quite certain that Augustus regarded Capricorn as his ‘ star ¹. Compare,
too, Horace’s orte Saturno, Odes i. 12. 50.¹

Of the contradiction in which we are thus involved, four
explanations seem possible:—

(1) Suetonius may have made a mistake when he wrote paulo
ante solis exortum. Whether it is possible to check him here by the
fact that in Aug. 94 he tells us that Augustus’ father ob τιτθῆς
puerperium arrived late for the meeting of the Senate (it must have
been an ‘extraordinary’ meeting) 1 do not know. He specifies the
hour of birth only, 1 think, of two other Emperors. Nero, like
Augustus, was born tantum quod exoriente sole paene ut radiis prius
quam terra contingeretur, xviii. Kal. Ian. (Nero 6). Vespasian was
born uesperi xv. Kal. Dec. (Vesp. 2). The sign of Nero, therefore,
was Sagittarius, that of Vespasian probably Gemini or Cancer. lt is
possible that numismatists may be able here to test the accuracy of
Suetonius.

Is I were writing a history of the Kings of England 1 should pretty
certainly, when Ι came to the reign of Edward VII, record the fact that
that monarch was born on Nov. 9. 1 might in addition (though it would
be an unusual thing to do) record the fact that he was born at
10.48 a.rn. of that day. It would probably be inferred that I had
consulted The Times of Nov. 10, 1841. The inference would, as
a matter of fact, be wrong. I, as a matter of fact, owe my knowledge
that this king was born at this hour to a horoscope cast for him the
day after his birth. 1 can go further back in history than this. If
Ι want to know the hour at which the first Duke of Wellington was
born, there are very few textbooks of astrology published in England
subsequently to Waterloo which will not tell me this. Suetonius was
interested in astrology, and lived among, and wrote sor, persons of
similar interests. It would be strange if he was not as likely to be
right about the birth-honr of Augustus or Nero as Ι about that of
Edward VII or the Duke of Wellington.

(2) Scaliger supposes the confusion of the Calendar in 63 Β. c. to
have been such that neither Augustus, nor Theagenes who cast his
horoscope, knew the true correspondence of months and signs.
Firmicus (quoted by Scaliger ad lzunc loc.) tells us that the first degree

¹ Capricorn is the ‘ house ' of Saturn.
