11 74o—7 COMMENTARY

here dodecatemoriu-——the Greek form, as Livy xxxviii. 13. 11 Gordiu-
tichos. But it is to be noted that authors who otherwise eschew the
genitive in -iz' occasionally permit it to themselves in Greek words3
as Verg. Aen. ix. 151 Palladii (if the line be genuine), a solitary
example, since fluuii in Aen. iii. 702 =fluuji‚ cf. Georg. i. 482
fluujorum—ll‘lart. xi. 27. 3 (31. 14) cybii, but elsewhere always the
single -i form. But the facts with regard to Manilius may easily be
misrepresented. He has dodeccttemoriz' here. But how many examples
are there of the single -ἰ form? Two only—in the words Aquari,
sagittari (which Cic. Aras. also uses). These are of frequent occur-
rence (e. g. 21 1, 2803 464, 505 alibi), but the phenomenon is confined to
these two words. It might reasonably be said, therefore, that Manilius
employs the -ί forin only when driven to it by the exigency of metre—
for Aquarii, Sagittarii are impossible in dactylic verse. ovid, to
whom Manilius stands nearer than to any other poet, frequently affects
the -i form. [Man. iii. 92 talis et illius sors est speranda negoti is
rightly obelized by Breiter‚ who omits, however, to remark upon the
form of the genitive]

It seems worth while—since the authority of Lachmann's note at
Lucr. v. 1006 has so long been paramount-to define here clearly the
usage of the Latin poets as between -ii and -ι“. The form in -ἰ may
be regarded as universal in the earliest poets‚ Ennius, Plautus, and
Terence. It is maintained consistently in Lucretius (save perhaps ν.
1006, vi. 743), Catullus (save perhaps ix. 5), Horace, Tibullus and Vergil.
ln Horace and Vergil it may perhaps be regarded as a conscious
archaism. Outside these poets the form in -iz' is admitted freely, save
in Persius and Martial, who revert to -z'. But even they confine their
use of -i almost exclusively to proper names. In view of Persius and
Martial it would in any case be temerarious to argue frorn the usage
of Manilius in this matter an Augustam date. And indeed the
employment of the -i form is not strictly Augustan. Like so much
else in Vergil and Horace it is a survival from the Republican
period.

747-8. Ι have followed Bentley in reading stella (so too Breiter)
sor stellae. Bentley further alters in (748) to pro, and renders cuius
enim dodecatemorii in fines stella inciderit, dabit illud effictus suos
pro uiribus eius stellae.

cuius, then = cuius dodecatemorli; but [lactea-alcmorion can hardly
be. as Bentley takes it, the subject of dabit. The subject of dabit is
stethu the planet will produce effects in the uires of the dodecatemory.
The dodecatemory has uires of its οιΑ-ης these are modified by the
accession of a planet.

Ellis, reading stellae in fines sub, renders : ⁶ In the region of what-
ever planet the dodecatemory under any sign falls, that planet will
exercise results on the workings of that dodecatemory.’ subis already
found in Regiomontanus; and no doubt the thrice repeated in is
awkward. But the rendering is open to the objection that, with it,
the dodecatemory is said to fall in the planet, whereas at 645—6 the
planet falls in the dodecatemory.

To the reading stellae a powerful objection‚ to my mind, is the
fact that there are in the whole of Manilius only two decently attested
examples of the elision of the last syllable of a spondaic word. These
are iv. 923 paruo in empore, v. 477 uitae ostendit. Either of these
might suffice to justify stellae here if there were no reasonable alterna-
tive. But neither can when there is. lllusory examples are 826 (see
