COMMENTARY 410ffi12

rura (where iustissima, Orelli ; sine eo tutzlvsima, Lachm. ; stgtzo tulis
sine, Baehrens) it is conceivable that szjgno = szgrno Astraeae, Iustitiae
with a play on the sense of a ‘landmark’. Prudentius Sym11mcl2.i.
464—6, speaking of the Labarum plays on the sense of szgrmcm
‘ standard ' and szgnum = szgnusn crucis ‘sign of the Cross ’3 so on
Christus—crista ib. 487-8. Similar is the double meaning given to
another military term ala at Verg. Georg. i. 382 cornorum increpuit
densis exercitus alis. See also n. on 887.
411. natura, ‘sex'; see on 383.

412. et genere: exemplis. No convincing emendation has been
suggested. 1 have provisionally printed genere, with Breiter, &c.‚ and
Ι would then take exemplis either (Ι) closely with mutua: ‘a concord
mutual in the matter of exainple‚’ i. e. a concord which each teaches to
the other; or (2) with paribus, removing the comma ordinarily placed
after surgit in 412. This, though I have no confidence in it, is at least
better than Du F ay, who interprets exemplis as = exempli causa.
What Breiter understands by exemplis he does not see fit to say, and
1 am not German enough to divine.

Bentley's et generis uinclis hits the sense needed, but is too far
from the ductus litterarum ; yet Ι prefer it to Housman’s (jacob’s) et
genere amplexis, which Ι think not Latin. Perhaps nec genere
exemptt'5‚ i. e. et non exemplis genere3 sor nec = et non cf. nec similis
