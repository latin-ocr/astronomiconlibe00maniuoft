OTHER MSS.

of the library of Bentley, and in it Bentley has made collatioris of
nine MSS.—-the two Oxford MSS.‚ V ²GL, the Palatinus, the
Venetus, and finally the Pithoeanus and V ³. Of V ³ he says
definitely that he took its readings from the margin of ed. Bonon.
He adds ‘eundem esse suspicor cum Vossiano‚ narn fere con-
veniunt '. That this is an error I have already shown. The
collation of Pithoeanus, again, merely reproduces Pithou's notes
as they are given in the Bodleian Line. D. 5. 13.

It is to be regretted that no Manilian student has called atten-
tion before to this book. Ι first became aware of its existence
from a note in Wordsworth's Correspondence of Bentley, p. 745.
It is important not for what it brings to the text of Manilius, but
for what it enables us, by a better classification of our MSS.‚ to leave
behind. 1 have still to speak of one MS. of which it gives us for
the first time an adequate knowledge-the Venetus.

4. Codex Venetus. This MS. has hitherto been known to us
from occasional citations of it in Bentley's edition, and a couple
of references to it in Gronovius' Observationes. Bentley assigned
it on Gronovius’ authority to the eleventh century.1 Breiter has
supposed that Gronovius mistook a fifteenth for an eleventh
» century MS„ and has wished accordingly to identify the Venetus
with the only MS. of Manilius which is to-day to be found in
Venice——the Marcianus. That this identification is impossible
has been shown clearly by Thielscher's examination of Marcianus.²
But it is not unlikely that, as Thielscher suggests, Wn. is one or
other of two MSS. of Manilius known to have been at one time
in the Library of St. Αηῐοηίο.3 On the other hand, Thielscher's
guess that Ven. and the Holkham MSS. are one and the same
(some of the St. Antonio books passed to Holkham) is shown to
be wrong by my own examination of the Holkham MS. Ι would
refer the reader to the account which I have given of this MS. in
the Classical Quarterly, 1909, pp. 57—9. It suffices to say here
that while the Holkham MS. belongs to the pure Italian family
(being possibly a copy of M), Veri. belongs to the Belgian recen-
sion. In the Trinity College volume which I have already men-
tioned Bentley has preserved to us, not indeed a full collation of

¹ Praef.‚ p. xiv. ² Rlz. filus„ 1907, pp. 46 sqq.
³ ib„ probably plut. xvi, since the other is merely described as antiquo
charactere, which may mean no more than the Italian fisteenth-century lettera

antica.
