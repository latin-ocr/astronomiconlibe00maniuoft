COMMENTARY 224—32

Marc. xvi. 12. 6 populosis gentzbus) will never do. On the other hand
scopulosus does not mean (1) saxati'lzs (Pliny ix. 51)· , qus saxoszs loczs
delectatur, Du Fay· , so Stoeber‚ ingeniously, comparing Pliny N. H.
xv. 7 frutzces saxosi. But cf. Pl'in. N. H. ix. 15. 51 (locustae) uiuunt
petroszs loccs, cancri mollibus; nor (2) saxosus in the sense of durata
cute tutus, as Jacob, Breiter. Breiter, of course, compares Val. F l
ii. 518 scopulosaque terga. He might have added Stat. Aclz. i. 56
scopulosaque cete; but in neither passage does scopulosus mean
durata cute t77tus.1n both passages it means, as here‚‘ towering’ or

‘projecting like a rock’. In fact, scopulosus Cancer is more or less
i. q. fastzgrza Cancrc in 510, snb'lzmem Cancrum in 512. Cf. saxei
dentes, ‘big as rocks' (like molares (lentes), Apul. Met. xi. 12.
Du Fay’ 5 rendering has this much truth in it that scopulosus was no
doubt suggested to Manilius as an alternative to sublimis by the fact
that Cancer is 777ar7'7777777 szgnum.

It is urged by commentators that scopulosus can mean only
‘full of scopuli& And it is true that this gives the usual force
of the termination -0577s. Yet in Vergil’s ramosa cornua (Ecl.
vii. 30), ramosus does not mean ‘full of rami', but ‘like ra777z''; just
as lzgrnosus means ‘like lzjgnum’, cadauerosus ‘like a cadauer’,
pumicosus ‘like pumex', hircosus ‘like a la‘rcus’. Compare also,
perhaps, 777077st7 (77)osus‚ por tentosns.

Neither Avianus Fab. iii. 1— 2 cancer l lzz'spzda saxoszs terga r'elzszt
aquis, nor id. xx. 7-8 (of a small fish) uix me saxoszs gemnetrzst effita
sub antri'ssudzt are in point, though 1 at one time thought that they
might support Du Fay’ s interpretation.

226. censentur: like census (see on 69), a favourite Manilian word:
below, 293 (where Scaliger 1s in error) dextris censentur szgna priora,
652 cognata quadratis corpora censentur szgnz‘s, 666 nno censetur
Aquarius astro, 677 non lege quadrati censentur. Construction with
Ι sub ιν. 246, 325. Cf. JuV. viii. 1— 2 longo sanguine censen' (vide May or
ad loc.;) c. laude tu0777777 (ib. 74). Somewhat differently Mart. Cap.
longitudine ᾠνρίιιιιιῖὶίαίεᾳιιε cens.

At ν. 217‘ uno censentm lumine cuncta’ should, Ι think, be
restored for ceu sunt 777.

229. dumosis: propter aculeum, Bonincontrius; but cf. dumosis

‚aruis Verg. Georg. ii. 180.

231— 2. These lines stood at the foot of a page in the archetype.
see Introduction, p. xxiv; 232 has usually been regarded as spurious,
but, oddly enough, 231 seems to have escaped²> suspicion (though
attempts have been made to emend it). Yet (1) the datives terrae . . .
undis involve an impossible Latin :—v. 419, which Breiter cites as
a parallel, is no parallel at all, since terrae, &c., there is governed by
creatum (2) the line seems clumsily modelled on iv. 795 (Capricorn)
ambzgruum sidus terraeque 777ar7'sq77e3 cf., though different, Aetna 594
terrae dubiusque 777ar7'sq77e (Aquarius here, indeed, may possibly, as
Scaliger thought, be a mere blunder for et aequoris [aequoris undis =
Lucr. ν. 374; Ovid Met. i. 3413 Am. ii. 11. 1]: secl sicqzccqzce delendus
uersus); (3) 230— 3 stand, by the removal of 231— —2‚ in their true
connexion— the connexion which the earlier editors strove to effect
by transposing 233 with 231- 2.

About 232 there can be little doubt. (1) the pam· manna of
Aquarius is necessarily marsna, and therefore not a777b7g77a3 (2)
Aquaerus. .‘'Aquar7 rs not tolerable, and no satisfactory emendation
has been proposed. Perhaps Bentley’ 5 transposition to a place after
