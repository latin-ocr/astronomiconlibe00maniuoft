OTHER MSS.

os which the first three are (as Ι have already pointed out) pro-
bably copies of C, while the last two are, it seems likely, copied
from c. The beginnings of the process of italicizing the Belgian
family are to be seen already in the corrections of c. So far as can
be judged‚ all the codices of the mixed, or Hungarian, family are
descended from [4- m (m standing here sor one or more MSS. of
the stirps Ιίαίίιη).2 This is certainly true of P, p, g, r1—these four
MSS. form a clear group.³ Another more or less defined group is
ΙΨ b, r2. Their close interrelation may be inferred from the fact
that in their tituli they all (1) give the dedication to Augustus
(so v however) ; (2) add ‘ poetae ' after the name ‘Manilii ’.

There remain B, 0, 7³, 72⁴, which there are no data for classifying.
B seems to be the latest of all our MSS—several printed editions
had already appeared when it was written. 0 contains some
curious transpositions which Ι have not seen reported from any
other codex. But it seems unlikely that from any of the MSS. of
the Hungarian family there will emerge anything of value for the
text of Manilius.

⁸ See above, pp. xliv—xlv. 1 think it not unlikely however that P is de-
scended from c through Pilh. P and V³ both omit 11. 716—17.

4 F, or some MS. closely akin to it, must have been employed by Regio-
montanus and by the ed. Bon.‚ as may be seen by comparing my App. Crit.
with the citations from Fin Bechert.
