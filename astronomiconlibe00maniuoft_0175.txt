COMMENTARY 23-31

flumina ; Ecl. v. 21 flumina nymphis (at end of line); Ovid Alei. ii. 16
fluminaque et nymphas et caetera numina ruris. But cf. ib. i. 192
sunt rustica numina nymphae.

24. pacis opus: Calp. Ecl. i. 65 (of Numa) pacis opus docuit. ln
a different application the phrase recurs in Maximianus ν. 2 (the
business of arranging a treaty between East and West).

25. quidam ε ut A ratus, Bonincontriu53 Eratosthenem tangit,
Scaliger. ln thus attacking the popular astronomy (the legends of
which he elsewhere (e. g. v. 538 sqq.) himself employs to good purpose),
Manilius has a double object. He wishes (1) to emphasize the com-
pletely new character, the entire originality‚ of his own theme: he is
primus . . . nouis Helicona mouere cantibus (4-5) ; (2) to lay stress on
the genuinely scientific character of astrology. Astrology, under the
patronage of the Stoic philosophy, was just rising to a place among
the sciences, and as this place was scarcely yet assured to it, the
astrologers were anxious to assert their independence of whatever was
either merely popular or at all fantastic. They are mathematici study-
ing in numbers and their laws human fate. See Introduction, p. lxv sqq·

26. Cf. Verg. A en. iii. 515 sidera . . . tacito labentia caelo ; Ovid Fast.
iii. 1 13 caelo labentia signa.

27. ‘ Referred each to its proper class and causes’: i.e. classed
them all and explained the causes of their becoming constellations.
These causes are given in the ablatives that follow—poena (28), raptu
(29), officio . . . lacte (30), &c.‚ each of these ablatives being dependent
grammatically on ductam in 31. lt is, however, possible that these
ablatives are governed by pendentia in 35 ; for pendere with abl. with-
out preposition see on 947.

For the causae and genera of the constellations as they are
variously given in the poets and mythographers see the laborious notes
of Joh. Moeller, Slud. Manz'l. init.

causasque: as Ovid Fast. v. 697 dic, ego respondi, causam milti
sideris huius .· causam facundo reddidit ore deus.

Andromedan: this form (a false Graecism: see on 365) seems
to be upon the whole the best attested : cf. v. 23, 545 ; and is apparently
preferred by Ovid (Met. iv. 671, 756). For the form Andromeden given
here by Bentley, whom most edd. follow, l can find no justification.
Andromedan is given by all MSS. at i. 356, v, 545.

29. solantemque: so Ven. rightly against the other MSS. Breiter
and others retain soluentemque either as (1) soluentem uinctam
uirginem, or (2) poenas soluentem-so at least Breiter. But (1) is
historically false; Perseus, not Cepheus, soluit Andromedan, (2) is
not Latin. Hyginus ii. 9-11. .

raptuque: Bentley's necessary correction of raplamqae3 raptu
falls into line with the other abll. poena, (fficio, pietate, &a
Ν Lyc· natam: Callisto = Ursa Mai0r; Hyginus ii. 1, p. 31. 1 ;
ιι. 4, . 34. 22.

30.poffici0 Iouis: quod olim Iouis nutrix erat (as also Callisto);
Hyginus ii. 1, p. 30. 4—31. 3 (Bunte).

( Cy)nosura = Ursa Minor3 Hyginus ii. 2, p. 31. 23 sqq.; Fab. 224
Bunte .

lacte Capellam: i. 366 nobilis et mundi nutrito rege Capella;
Hyginus ii. 13 (Ovid, Manilius, and Pliny alone, according to Moeller,
use the name Capella for Capra or Olenie).

31. furto: quia sormam oloris indutus luppiter Ledam amabat,
Hyginus ii. 8, p. 45. 11-13 (Bunte). „
