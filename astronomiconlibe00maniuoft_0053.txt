OTHER MSS.

fifteenth-century MS. with the exception of filare. (which is a copy
of C), or some descendant of Marc„ as e. g. the Pithoeanus. The
contamination has not gone far enough.

(2) It is not, like Marcianus, derived from C. For though it
omits, as do GL, III. 188, it contains IV. 312, 746. (At IV. 235
Bentley's notes, as so often at important places, are silent.)

(3) Though Bentley does not tell us whether it has been
affected by the great transposition III. 399—IV. 10, yet he does tell
us that with GL it omits IV. 731—2 and V. 12 b—13 a preserved by
M. This would hardly have been the case if it had been corrected
by the aid of M.

(4) It as often as not imports into its text readings of M which
are false and meaningless, where the Belgian text has the true
lection.

(5) Occasionally its readings are true or half true where those
of all our other MSS. are false, and one or two of these half-true
readings (though I am clear that it is a MS. which has suffered
much from interpolation) can hardly have been reached by con-
jecture.

(6) The only reason that can be alleged for assigning it to
saec. xv is that it carne from Venice, and that the only Manilian
MS. now in Venice, Marc„ is of fifteenth-century date. But that
Ven. and Marc. are not one and the same MS. was made clear as
soon as their readings were placed side by sidc.

Ι proceed to give a list of passages where Ven. agrees with M
against GL.

*IL 323 et uenit Ven. M: euenit GL.

*HL 32 quorumque Ven. M: quorum quaeq(ue) GL.

³⁵ The asterisk in each case indicates that the reading os Ven. M is here
salse.
