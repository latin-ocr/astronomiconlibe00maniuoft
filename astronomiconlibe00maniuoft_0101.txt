MANILIUS AND HIS EDITORS

hardship. It is written in a light and graceful Latin such as is
now becoming, alas, rather rare3 and it contains much happy
illustration and suggestive conjecture. One or two emendations
(e. g. Ι. 739, lIl. 398) may be regarded as certain. It is perhaps
a pity that this Silua is not more ample than it is. For it does
not pretend to a sustained exegesis, and hardly goes beyond a col-
lection of ‘suspiciones ⁷. It is probably the only modern book
upon Manilius which a feeling reader could wish to have been
longer.

Of Mr. Housman's edition of Book I, with its numerous cor-
rections of II—IV, Ι have said rnuch of what Ι think elsewhere.¹
1 regret that some parts of it should have been written by so
charming a poet as the author of A Slzropshire Lad. Mr. Housman’s
book has excited a good deal of angry feeling, and it is always a
missortune when such feeling is excited among scholars—whose
studies demand for their happy prosecution an even quietude.
But this angry feeling will before long die down. And when it
has done so, the real merit of Mr. Housman’s work will, I think,
be widely allowed. Very few editors of Manilius have understood
, their author so well. And this thorough understanding of Manilius
Mr. Housman has not reached without a searching discipline.
The greatness of his book is what does not appear in it—the hard
work behind it. The external glitter is delusive. It hides an
amount of solid and honest labour which the student of Manilius
will recognize with increasing clearness in proportion as he himself
grows in knowledge of his subject. It is this underlying austerity
of learning which gives to Mr. Housman’s work its real distinction.

We live in an age of learned pamphlets, and Manilius, like
greater men, has had to endure the tender mercies of aspirants to
a continental doctorate. Ι have thought it my duty to peruse so
much of the occasional literature upon Manilius as is to be found
in the Bodleian Library ; and Ι would not, if I could, accuse with
cold words the zeal of the Librarian. My table, as I write, is
strewn with sheafs of excerpts from this literature. Richter says
somewhere that a book, to be worth reading once, must be worth
reading twice. If this is to be true also of a pamphlet, few will
be saved. A pamphlet perhaps justifies itself if it can be read*-
or most of it—-at all. It is beside my purpose to do more than
