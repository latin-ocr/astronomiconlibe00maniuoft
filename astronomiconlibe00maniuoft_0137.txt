Certain signs, furthermore‚ have agreement one with
another, according to laws of their own individuality: and
sustain a fixed fellowship. They direct their gaze on one
another and hang their hearing on each other's speech3
they bear hate or love to one another. Some of them turn
their regard upon themselves, and are drawn to themselves
by the fullness of their own attraction. Sometimes there
is love among opposed signs, and they wage war in
alliance one with another3 signs which by position have
no common tie join men at birth in a friendship that
never dies3 while men born under the signs of the same
triangle, contend with and shun one another. The cause
of this lies in God, who, when he placed all his universe
under law, also appointed for the stars feelings of their own
whereby they differ. He brought together the eyes of
some, the ears os others: some he joined in the bonds os
enduring friendship. And thus it is that certain of them
behold or hear one another3 others love or bear spite and
wage war. Others, yet again, are overkind to that which is
of themselveS, ever in love with themselves, and pleasing in
their own eyes. And we see the same law at work in the
inoods of wellnigh all mankind: for they derive their
— character from the stars that bnild their nativity. The
Ram hearkens to his own counsel, as becomes a leader.
He hears himself, and beholds the Balance, and loves the
Bull with a baffled love. For the Bull weaves guile for the
Ram, and beyond the Ram sees the Fishes shining and
hearkens to them across the Ram's stars. His heart is
caught with love of the Maid. Aforetime, in days long
ago, he carried her upon his back—she was Europa, and
her left hand held his horns, and his form was a covering
for the form of Jove. The ears of the Twins are directed
to the lad that for ever pours out water sor the Fishes, their
heart is directed towards the Fishes themselves, their eye
to the Lion. The Crab, and Capricorn, whose star is
established over against him, turn their eyes upon them·
selves, their ears strain towards one another, and the Crab
bears hate towards the &Vater-carrier. But the Lion sees
eye to eye with the Twins and hearkens to the double
Centaur‚ and loves the sign of Capricorn. Erigone beholds
the Bull; but she hears the Scorpion, and she is sain to
