conception, allowed himself inadvertently to write natus for genitus.
It is no doubt for this reason that Scaliger abandons in his second
edition the view taken up in his first.

(4) It remains to ask whether it is not after all possible that the
pre-Julian Sept. 22 fell, in 63 13.C., into or very nearly into the Julian
Dec. 22. If this were so our difficulties would at once disappear—
Augustus' birth would fall at sunrise on pre· -Julian Sept. 23, under
Capricorn. The translation of pre· Julian into Julian dates involv,es
os course, problems of lmmense intricacy upon which no two scholars
agree; and the field is one, let me say frankly, where Ι arn not in any
way competent to speak. 1 consusted, however, Mr. J. K. Fothering-
ham, whose authority in difficulties connected with the ancient
Calendars is unimpeachable. The substance of what follows belongs
to him. But I owe it to Mr. Fotheringham to state clearly that he
does not regard himself as committed to the position which this note
takes up. But he was at great pains to supply me with the
figures and arguments for that position, and to explain to me the
principal ancient authorities—with the interpretations of some modern
critics-notably Stoffel in his Guerre Civile, Soltau in Rbmz'sclze
C'lzronologz‘e, Grinzel, Handbuclz der mathematz'sclzen u. lechm'sclzen
Chronologie, ii. 160—293‚ and Rice Holmes in T he Julian Calendar (an
Appendix to his work Ancz'ent Britain)-—the most important English
contribution to the subject. The calculatione subjoined follow the
general position of Stoffel (based upon Le Verrier ; see Rice Holmes,
p. 710) more closely than that of any other authority. From limits
of space they are exposed here somewhat elliptically‚ and must not
be thought to ignore arguments which they pass by.

The Julian Calendar came into operation on Jan. 1, 45 Β. C. The
first bissextile year was 41 Β. C. At any rate, no previous Julian
intercalation is attested ; and, whatever may be made of Dio Cassius’
statement (48. 33. ξ 4) about the violation in that year of Caesar's
regulafion, it is certain that (1) that year toas what we call a ‘ Leap
Year’3 (2) it ended with a market day.¹ That the first year of the
New Calendar contained a bissexto Kal. Mart. is in itself unlikely.
We have then the following correspondences :—

Η. C. Civil Julian
41 Jan. 1 Jan. 1
42 Jan. 1 Jan. 1
43 Jan. 1 Jan. 1
44 Jan. 1 Jan. 1
45 Jan. 1 Jan. 2

These reckonings, and those that follow, take no account ot' any
intercalation not directly attested. This procedure, considering the
bulk of our evidence for the years between 63 and 41 is not unreasonable.
There was a new moon on Jan. 2, 45, and the new Calendar probably
began on that day.

About the year 46 our evidence is conflicting. Suetonius (Jul. 40)
says that three months were intercalated in that year. Censorinus
(D. Ν. 20. 4 ξ 8) also adds to the normal mensis Mer'cedonms the two
months placed by Julius between November and December— reckoning
these two months as 67 days. Dio Cassius, on the other hand
(43. 26. ἓξ 1—2), definitely denounces this as an error, and says that the

¹ The importance for our calculations of this market day will appear later.
