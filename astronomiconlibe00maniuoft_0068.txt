INTRODUCTION III

The last line can only mean, Ι think, ‘when it received the
light of the world in the person of Caesar,' i. e. Tiberius Caesar.

And in that case Tiberius was emperor when the line was written.
Of the last verses of Book IV

ne dubites homini diuinos credere uultus,
iarn facis ipse deos mittisque ad sidera numen
maius et Augusto crescet sub principe caelum

Mr. Housman says dogmatically that ‘they prove nothing either
way’. Why, none of these passages—save perhaps 764—6—by
themselves prove anything either way. The proof is cumulative.
But these concluding lines of Book IV have their importance.
If 764—6 show that Augustus was already dead, 9 33—5 show that
he was only just dead. On any other assumption ‘Augusto sub
principe' is inexplicable ,- nor is it likely that, if Augustus had
been in his grave for any length of time, Manilius would have
gone out of his way to pay him an elaborate compliment which
might very well have offended Tiberius.

Books I—II, then, were written between A. D. 9 and Α. D. 14.
Book IV was finished probably in A. D. 14—15.

In A. D. 16 occurred an event which must have had an important
effect upon Manilius’ studies and have greatly influenced the
fortunes of his poem. This was the conspiracy of Libo Drusus.
The prophecies of ‘Chaldean' astrologers <the two prin—cipal
persons among them bore lfoman names) were supposed to have
incited Libo Drusus to treason against the Emperor, and the
discovery of this conspiracy put a rude check upon the progress
of astrological science. A senate servile and alarmed, which
desired prophets who should prophesy only good things, outlawed
the whole body of mathematici.¹ This edict of A. D. 16² is the
most natural explanation of the condition of Manilius’ poem as
we have it, of its inconsistencies, its occasional incoherence, the
traces in it everywhere of want of finish. But if this is so, it
seems probable that Manilius did not long survive the edict
which had thus interrupted his studies. For it would appear
from Suetonius³ that the edict was rescinded shortly after its
promulgation. It was just one of several edicts such as, appear-
ing in a fitful series under the early empire‚ provoked Tacitus to

 

¹ Tac. Ann. ii. 32.
² Ulpian‚ Mos. ct Rom. Leg. coll. xv. 2, places this edict in the consul-
ship of Pomponius and Rufus—i. e. A.n. 17. ²³ Tib. 36.
