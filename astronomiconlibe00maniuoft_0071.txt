MANILIUS AND HIS EDITORS

with mathematics, was endeavouring to accommodate his principles
to those of the natural sciences¹ Augustus himself, therefore,
ever forward to assist the advance of knowledge or of art, was
likely enough to be not unfriendly disposed to the mathematici.
He was not perhaps a man of great imagination 3 but the poetry
of the stars is impressive to the imaginative and to the un-
imaginative alike. His mind, moreover, was tinged with that
contented fatalism which so often characterizes men whom
fortune has called from a private station to supreme power. The
Exordium to the first book of the Astronomim ‘gives the glory'
to Augustus. The poem is his as much as the Aeneid is his, or
the Georges Maecenas'. He is the ‘author and begetter '. What
wonder that his star should shine so bright that it marvels at its
own brilliancy?

But it was hardly without Augustus’ contrivance that in 33 B. c.
Agrippa‚² as aedile, expelled from Rome ‘the astrologers and
magffins' (τοὺς ἀστρολόγους καὶ τοὺς γόητας ἐκ τῆς πόλεως
ἐξήλασεν). But it would be wrong, I think, to regard this edict
as directed either against astrologers as such or against all
astrologers. It is most natural to connect it with the activity of
· Antony during this year in Media and the East. It touched not
Roman astrologers <such as th‘ose who suffered under the edict
of A. D. 16 3 see above, p. lxiv), but the Oriental μάγοι. It may
even be doubted whether astrology as such was not too powerful
an organization for Augustus to offend. Religion, literature, and
popular thought were all by this time deeply imbued with
astrological doctrine. The influence of astrology upon religion
was notable in two respects: (1) A rapprochement had taken
place between the mathematici and the Etruscan haruspiqu.
Nigidius represents the two arts in their combination.3 u(2) From
this period onward ‘catasterisin' becomes the form under which
human immortality is ordinarily conceived. Still stronger was
the hold which astrology had upon literature and popular thought.
One might appeal here to Virgil himself—to the ‘ star of Dionaean
Caesar' in the ninth Eclogue, to the (largely astrological) doctrine
of ἀποκατάστασις in the fourth—but Virgil stands too much out
