INTRODUCTION III

with such advantage as his fair text and fair MSS. gave him, was
equal to the task bequathed to him. Parts of it he discharged
not over-scrupulously: often, indeed, he is contumaciously lazy 3
but to his edition Manilian scholarship owes more than to any
work save Scaliger's.¹

I think it worth while to say a word or two on the subject of the
dates connected with the composition of Bentley's Manilius.
Bentley was born in 1662. The earliest references which Ι can
find to the projected commentary belong to the year 1692. The
idea first suggested itself to him perhaps as a result of his Oxford
visit—he went to Oxford with the young Stillingfleet in 1689. In
Oxford he seems to have made acquaintance with Edward Bernard,2
Savilian Professor of Astronomy and a collector of books and MSS.
It must have been in Oxford that he first saw Bernard's MS. of
Manilius now in the Bodleian, together with the Corpus MS. In
1699 the Manilius was finished. In that year, at any rate, Bentley
writes in the Preface to the Phalaris (lxiii) that ‘it (Manilius) had
been published already, had not the dearness of paper, and the want
os good typeS, and some other occasions hindered '. It was not as
a matter of fact published until thirty years later. But it would be
a mistake to regard it as a work which Bentley pondered for fifty
years, Substantially it was finished when he was thirty-seven
years old. It was in fact a work of his youth, and its virtues are
those of youthful work, viz. independence and abounding virility.
On the other hand it is, though it has many faults, notably free
from such faults as are commonly charged to youth. There is, for
example, no inaccuracy in the Manilius—and that in a subject-
matter so complicated that few scholars have avoided serious
mistakes. Nor, again, is the rashness of conjecture which cha-
racterizes parts of the Manilius to be regarded as a fault of youth.
Bentley's rashness in Manilius is nothing to what may be seen in
his Horace—written when he was in his fiftieth year. He grew,
in fact, more and more rash as he grew older, just because he grew
more and more petulant and intolerant. The real fault of the
Manilius is the same fault as that which caused its publication to
be so long delayed-laziness. The book was ready in 1699. Ten

¹ ls we except Scaliger, Pingre's judgement is just ‘une edition qui fit
oublier toutes les editions anterieures '.

a place in Dr. Sandys* History ofScltolarslzip.
