II 349-52 COMMENTARY

(347), or (2) has too few degrees (348), or (3) ‘executes now three,
now four, bends (forming a triangle or quadrangle), which logie some-
times compels to continue themselves into more signs than are allowed
sor in the Circle by the number of degrees it contains’ (349-51).

3 50-1. If you draw the first line of, say, your triangle from the first
degree of Aries to the last os Leo, you will, in order to construet an
equilateral triangle‚ have to carry your second line to some point out-
side the Zodiacal Circle3 and so too your third line. You will want, in
other words, plura signa than there are.

352-7, These lines, it has been urged, involve Manilius in a curious
illogicality. He is trying to say that the bond between triangular signs
is stronger than that between quadrangular signs. If he is trying to
say that, how is it in point to say that the uisus of quadrangular signs
is further from earth, from us, than that of the signs of triangular
schematism ? Surely what matters is not whether the signs see us but
whether they see one another.
1 am not clear that this objection, urged e. g. by Bouche-Leclercq,
p. 174, is valid. That triangular association was the strongest of all
schematisms was universally recognized by astrologer53 and it is true
that the bond between quadrangular signs was usually regarded as
weak, and their relation an antipathetic one. But Manilius nowhere
gives his adherence to the vulgar view, as it may be called, that quad-
rangular signs are less closely related to one another than are trian-
