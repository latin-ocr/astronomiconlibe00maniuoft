COMMENTARY 423-33

ing is, as Lachmann saW‚ ne suspecta tibi sint haec . . . altaria, paruos
ltz'c habet heredes (nec an neu codd.).

In 429 Ι have written permixtusque for pernulrtosque, but have
not otherwise altered the text of this difficult passage. At 424 I have
retained repugnat3 and this seems necessary if ratione pari est, in
427, is sound. The subject of ratione pari est is, of course, szgnum,
and not et hoc et illud—as Breiter. But if repugnat and pari est be
sound, then, not Libra et Aries, but tempora must be the subject of
efficiunt in 428; and the object of efficiunt must be quo minus
decertent (decertant has no MS. authority) in 431. This will explain
why Ι have changed permixtosque to permixtusque (429).

In 425-6 the quia of quia differt is carried on to (quia) implet;
—tlhe ordinary punctuation obscures this. Postgate transposes 426
an 427.

The construction of 428-31 is ε temporaque simili textu concordia
et permixtus dz'es‚seruantia (i. e. tempora et permixtus dies quae seruant)
uno tempore et hiemem et aestatem‚—qu0niam articuli (in quibus sunt
Aries et Libra) medii inter hiemem et aestatem positi sunt,-(ltaec
omnia) efficiunt quo minus infesto bello decertent sidera.

The repetition tempora (428) ...tempore (430) is a piece of
carelessness similar to that noted on 409.

430. articulis: cardinal points, as 657 z'n quibus articulos anni
deus ipse cream't; Plin. Ν. H. xviii. 222 cardines singulis etiamnum
articulis temporum diuiduntur3 cf. anm· nodus, Lucr. v, 687—8.

432. For the position of this line in the pagination of the archetype,
see Introduction. diuersis cannot be taken as = aduersis, and
editors are generally agreed in rejecting the line.

433-52. Each sign has its tutelar deity. See Figure. Editors,
from Scaliger onward, have noticed the irrelevance here of this passage
(as well as of 4 5 3-8 5). The list hardly belongs to scientific astrology at
all—nothing could be more naive than the principles by which parti-
cular tutelae fall to particular deities, as e. g. Mercury has the tutela
of Cancer because Cancer possesses a testudo, as did the tortoise
which Mercury converted into the Lyre. We seem to be somewhere
midway between an astrology of planetary οἶκοι and the popular dogma
which assigned certain months to certain gods. The K alendarium
Rusticum, C. l. L., i. 1². pp. 280 sqq., gives a similar disposition of
tutelae with both the names of the months and the Zodiacal signs. In
the K alendamum, however, the tutelae are each thrown back a place,
so that e. g. Pallas guards not Aries but Pisces, Venus not Taurus but
Aries, and so on throughout. (Mommsen’s explanation of this dis-
crepancy is no doubt right: ‘. . . man einerseits das in der Mitte des
Monats eintretende Thierkreiszeichen‚ andererseits die Schutzgottheit
des zu Anfang des Monats obwaltenden Thierkreiszeichens auf den
ganzen Monat bezogen hat’: Rb'misclze Chron. ed. i, p. 268.) The
Altar of the xii Gods at Gabii (Visconti silon. Gab. tav. 7-8) points to
the Manilian system (e. g. the tripod of Apollo stands against Gemini).
The list is in origin clearly not Roman—for in that case Mars would
have had the tutela of Aries = mensis Martius, Juno of Cancer =
mensis Junins ; as in the lists in Scaliger Astron. Vet. Scrzpta, Sanct-
andreae 1589, pp. 159-673 Bucheler Carm. Engrr. i, pp. 205-6, 210.
Mommsen (Re'mz'sclze Cla-on. ed. i, pp. 264 sqq., ed. ii, pp. 305 sqq.)
traces the list back to Eudoxus. Eudoxus, however, he supposes
simply to have adapted oriental sources, Egyptian or Chaldean. Boll,
in an Appendix (sphaera 472-8) upon Valens’ Σφαιρικά, follows
