PREFACE

Who left thee nameless in the signs?
Who wreathed so nigh the Serpent’s coil?

Who made in heaven whatever shines
So puissant‚ yet broke thee with toil?

The hand that fixed thy fate in fire,
And wrought to melancholy flame
The load that bows, the knees that tire,
The agony that knows no name 2-—

That master hand and merciless
Made even as thou art thy sons:
The strong knees in obscure distress
Sink slowly under him that runS.

Ah! not sor them the Crown, the Lyre:
They see the Serpent's lifted head,
They feel his hot breath's stinging fire,
Their hands hold off a subtle dread.

The goal that lesser souls attain
Recedes before their nobler strife ,
Their name none knoweth‚ nor their pain:
These are thy failures, Lord of Life!
