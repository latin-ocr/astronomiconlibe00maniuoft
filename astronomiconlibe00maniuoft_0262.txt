At the following places Thielscher notes that M cannot be deci-
phered certainly: 234 amicit] uel simile aliquid 345 uecfi (uel
necfi) 372 cue (uel one) ¹ 642 fortasse geum 675 fortasse
imitantes.² At 665 he calls attention to the fact that M really testifies
to nec iurzgitur. The scribe wrote, as Thielscher thinks, ne cingitur.
It would be possible to read this as ne cingitur, but it more probably
stands for ne cingitur = nec z’rzgitur (the true reading). Such wrong
separation of words is constant in M (so constant that I have not
always thought it worth recording).

Thielscher for the first time supplies the marginal lemmata to L.
(Why these were omitted by Breiter, who carefully records the lemmata
of GM, 1 do not know.) With regard to these he writes: ‘ Die in L
am Rande angebrachten Lemmata erinnern in der Kleinheit ihrer
Buchstaben lebhaft an die Schreibart des Cusanus.’

Ι add here two admonitions: (1) My Apparatus does not take full
account of the use in this or that MS. of contractioris (save where some
critical question seemed involved); (2) the symbols G2L2stq2 repre-
sent, as I have stated elsewhere, a manus correctrix aequaeua in GLM.
But quite often this manus aequaeua is apparently the hand of the
original scribe (G1L1M1). In my Apparatus, therefore, G¹G²‚ for
example, means merely two coeval variants, and must not be taken to
imply necessarily diversity of script.
