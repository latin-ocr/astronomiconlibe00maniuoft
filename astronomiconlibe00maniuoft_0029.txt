THE THREE PRINCIPAL MSS.

space of one line in L). Now in llI153 is followed not by 154-5
——the first lines of 47 v, but by 175-6, the first lines of the page
following. It is difficult to escape the suspicion that the scribe of
M was actually transcribing A. That I have reckoned the pages
in this book correctly is made additionally probable by the fact
that (omitting the spurious line 317—which perhaps stood in the
margin of A) 549 will be the last line of a page (56 v) 3 and after
549 there is a generally recognized lacuna.¹

Book III probably ended at fol. 59 v, that page thus containing
24 lines to avoid carrying over the last two lines of the book to
a new folium. The first page of IV (59 v) will then, like the first
page of ΙΙΙ, have contained a titulus and lines 1—2 1. This is
probable in itself‚ ancl seems to be guaranteed by the fact that
396 would thus be the last line of a page (68 v) 3 and in GLMwe
find 388 transposed to follow 396. (I have not reckoned the
spurious line 298.) Look now at IV. 132. It was the first line of
a page in A. Its edges would be liable to damage 3 and we find
that M omits altogether the last word of the line, uestes. GL
have kept uestes; but A, when it lay before the scribe of Alf, was
some five hundred years older than when it was copied by the first

’ ancestor of GL. Once again, IV. 198 was the last line of fol. 64 v

in A 3 and M omits it.

These facts taken in conjunction seem to me sufficient to make
probable the inference that M was copied direct from A. And
this inference may, I fancy, be supported by a piece of evidence
which lies outside Manilius. In M, as is well known, Manilius
is bound up with the Sz'luae of Statius. Krohn long ago put forward
the opinion, accepted by both Vollmer and Klotz, that M in the
Siluae is copied frorn an original which contained 44 lines to the
page. It was this consideration which led me at one time, as
I have said, to entertain the view that the archetype of Manilius
contained 44, and not 22 lines to the page. But I now think
that the facts which Krohn adduces are equally well, or even
better, explained by the hypothesis that M in the Siluae derives,
like our GLM, frorn a MS. containing 22 lines to each page?

² Krohn's case rests really upon two passages. At Siluae iv. 3. 79 is
found a marginal correction which belongs to iv. 3. 35. At the end of
v. 1. 81 the word arctos has crept in from v. 1. 127 (of which it is last word),
ousting the true reading auster. Iexplain both these accidents by supposing
a leaf os 44 lines (22 lines to the page) of which the margin had been torn,
