MANILIUS AND HIS EDITORS

such a studied panegyric as Mr. Housman bestows upon them
(though his paragraphs are true and tellingly expressed) seems
perhaps a little banal. Bentley's great merits are his fine sense
for Latinity, his knowledge os all Latin, his wide experience in the
pathology of texts his unbeaten ingenuity in conjectural emenda—
tion. In these he has no rival.¹ He possesses in addition a pithy
style of racy commentation which leaves the reader never tired.
(Even the undertones of malice afford an ashamed pleasure.)
Moreover Bentley, though he makes mistakes‚ never fails to redeem
them. If he emends unnecessarily he commonly in so doing
illustrates his author in some happy and relevant way. If he
emends wrongly‚ where emendation is none the less necessary, yet
he is usually more or less right, even there 3 he gets to the kind of
thing that Manilius must have written. Nothing impresses one so
much in reading his notes as again and again the sense that if
this is not right something very like it must be. Many corrections
which are far removed from the ductus litterarmn—as axe for omni
at III. 374—yet compel assent3 even more violent alterations
still—such as ΙΙ. 371, sexangula for subeuntia—‘give us pause.'
Viewed as a work of sustained exegesis Bentley's edition is
clearly inadequate. His interpretations never put before us the
evolution through all its parts ofa sustained argument. He fiashes
his light fitfully on patches of the argument. But he does not
supply a continuous and steady illumination. Not possessing
Scaliger's infinite erudition‚ he does little towards illustrating the
subject-matter of the Astronomzka from other sources. Perhaps,
indeed, when we compare him with Scaliger, we must, to be just,
view his work as purely that of a textual critic. Asatextual critic
he is easily Scaliger's superior in elegance, though Scaliger cor-
rected the text with certainty in more places than Bentley. We
must remember, however, that Bentley started with a fair text and
with good MS. material. Scaliger started with a text utterly
chaone, and being concerned mainly to remove the more obvious
and hideous of its blemishes, it is not surprising that in the depart-
ment of elegance he left a good deal to Bentley 3 ² nor that Bentley,
