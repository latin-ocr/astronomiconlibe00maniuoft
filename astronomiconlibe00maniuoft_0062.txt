MANILIUS AND HIS EDITORS

‘Wolbt sich der Himmel nicht dadroben‚
Und steigen freundlich blickend
Ewige Sterne nicht herausss’-G0i:mz.

I have called this section spsam'lius and his Edz‘t0r5‚ and if
there is rather more in it about the editors than about Manilius
that is because the former are so numerous and of the latter so
little is known. The very name of Manilius is not certain, and
his generation who shall tell? Our earliest authorities for the
name are Poggio¹ and F rancesco Barbaro,² of whom the former
speaks of ‘ M. Manilium Astromicon ' (sic), the latter of ‘ Manilium
Astronomum '. Consonant with this is the subscriptio8 to Book I
in the Codex Matritensis, ‘M. Manili Astronomi con⁴ (sic) Liber
Primus Explicit.’ But the same MS. has elsewhere ‘ M. Manlii
Boeni ⁷, and again ‘M. Milnili ’. The Codex Gemblacensis, which
has lost its titulus, gives no name in its subscriptions3 while the
Leipsic MS. assigns the poem to Aratus (‘Arati Philosophi Astro-
nomicon Liber Primus Incipit Prelibatio >).

But a scholar who lived somewhat later than Poggio and
Barbaro is perhaps a better witness than either to the name
Manilius. Politian refers to the ancient codex of Manilius which
he found in Padua⁵ as a MS. of ‘ M. Manilio astronomo e poeta
antiquo '. It is no doubt an over-statement when Sabbadini says
that this reference establishes the name with certainty. Yet it
seems inore than probable that Politian found this name

¹ C. 9., 1909, p. 583 cf. C. R„ xiii, p. 125.

2 L'Enfant, Poggiuna, ii. 314.

⁸ The titulus osM is in a seventeenth-century hand.

⁴ i. e. Astronomicwn. Scaliger at i. titulus, and Comment. p. 5 has mis-
understood this Greek genitive.
