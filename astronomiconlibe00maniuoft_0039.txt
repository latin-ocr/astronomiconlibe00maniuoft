NOTE ΟΝ THE MADRID MS.

vaguely, and says, what did not need saying, that the titulus must
have been written after M had lost its first folio (sps begins at
Manilius, I. 83). Wishing to be rather more accurately informed,
I showed to Mr. Madan, of the Bodleian Library, a photograph
of the page of M containing the titulus.l Mr. Madan, with his
wide palaeographical knowledge, was able to say confidently that
the titulus was written in the late sixteenth, or early seventeenth,
century. It follows that π cannot have been added to P before
that date.

On the other hand, P and π can hardly have been eonjoined
after the sixteenth century 3 for it is reasonable to suppose that
their conjunctior} followed upon the separation of P from lis, and
the bindings of Pand M belong to the sixteenth century. This
piece of knowledge Ι owe to the courtesy of the Sub-Librarian of
the Madrid National Library, who very kindly settled for me one
or two doubtful points in connexion with these MSS. On the
question of bindings he writes z ⁶ Membranaceum uero inuolucrum
quo ambo Msti teguntur saeculo xvi0 additum, ut ex litteris in
umbilico utriusque uoluminis appositis inferri potest.’

About 1600, then, M and P were disjoined, and P was bound
up with π. Poggio therefore had nothing to do with connecting
Ρ and π ; and, indeed, why should he conjoin authors so unrelated
as Sigebert and Valerius-Asconius ? ²

That Ρ is throughout written in Poggio's hand there is no
· reason to doubt. Clark holds that π also is a Poggian autograph.
The hands of P and π are admittedly very dissimilar; but it is
thought that this difference may be accounted for by supposing
that P is Poggio’s more careful hand, while π is swiftly and rather
carelessly written. This explanation, however, is scarcely tenable.
1 showed photographs of both hands to Mr. Madan, who was not
able to think thern identical. He pointed out to me that even if
it were possible to explain the dissimilarity of the minuscule
characters by the hypothesis of a bella manus and a uelox manus,
yet in both MSS. the capitals (initials and headings) are written
with great care and are yet totally different, e. g. P writes Ah, π
ΛΗ. Moreover, I understand Clark to identify P with the
actual MS. sent by Poggio to Nicolaus. Yet, speaking of that
MS. to Guarino (Tonelli, p. 29), he says that he wrote it uelociter.
But P and π cannot both be Poggio's uelox manus.

As a matter of fact, it is improbable that P is the actual MS.
sent by Poggio to N icolaus3 for between 142 3-9 Poggio is
constantly asking Nicolaus to return to him this codex: e. g.
Tonelli, pp. 207, 294, 303. The most instructive of the passages
where he makes this request is p. 207 ε ‘ Expecto Valerium
Flaccum, Pedianum, et Varronem, quae forsan transcribam, ni

¹ This photograph‚ with others 1 shall mention, was very kindly lent to
me by Mr. Clark.

² Valerius and Asconius are eonjoined because they were found together.
