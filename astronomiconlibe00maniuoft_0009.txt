PREFACE

THE· second book of the Astronomica is at once the
longest and the most difficult. In this book Manilius
passes from the popular astronomy with which he is
occupied in Book I to the proper business of the mathe-
maticus—to an astrology based on geometrical and arith-
metical calculations. He passes‚ that is, from a subject
moderately diverting to one difficult and repellent. Many
students of Latin poetry make their way through the first
book. A moderate scholar can understand it, and it has
recently been well edited. But few, probably, of those
'who read the first achieve also the second book. The
‘ signorum lucentes undique flammae '‚ the ἄστρων ὁμήγυρις-
all that is picturesque and inviting. But when we come
on to triangles, quadrangles, hexagonS‚ dodecatemorieS,
and the dodecatemories of dodecatemories—then our saith
In a Providence which has made the beautiful so hard
begins to fail us. And not only is the second book hard,
but the commentaries upon it are hard too. No one
commentary suffices; and even when he has all the com-
mentaries before him, the student will still be in want of a
means of approach to them—for none of them furnishes
a real Introduction to Manilius. Some ot them, indeed,
are often not very honestly put together. Even Scaliger,
with his encyclopaedic learning, is not above dissembling
in a base silence his occasional ignorance—-though mostly he
is unwilling rather than unable to help the mere beginner:
for he is a great man writing for his peers. Du Fay, who
alone of editors sets out to simplify Manilius, brought to
some capacity for teaching not only a loose conscience but
a verylimited knowledge and a faulty scholarship.
