PREFACE

of second-rate scholarship. S. Giinther’s Astronomz'e u.
Astrologi& in Mulier’s flaudbnclc V. i. 64—95‚ has no
pretensions to being anything more than a mere sketch
of its subject.

In the Dictionaries, Sch'onfeld's Astronomz'e in Pauly's
Real-Encyclopc'z'dz‘e is no longer usesul. It is replaced, for
Astrology, by Riess’ article in Pauly-Wissowa—-an article
which has great value as a bibliography and as a history,
but which as an outline of the principles of Astrology (the
author concerns himself mainly with the T etrabz'blos) is not
particularly helpful. Martin's Astronomz'a in Darembert et
Saglio is still useful. The articles Astrology and Astronomy
in Smith’s Dictionary are somewhat slipshod and antiquated.
I may add that the best English Introduction to Astronomy
is that of Young ( T extbook· of General Astronomy by C. A.
Young: Boston, Ginn ἃ Co„ 1899).

1 have many debts of a more personal kind. Dr. P.
Thielscher not only very generously lent to me his collation
of L, and instructed me in many places as to the true
reading of M, but he was also kind enough to correct in
proos the record of readings in my Apparatus. Ι owe
it to him, and to the Rev. C. T. H. Walker—who
lent me his collation of G-——that my Apparatus is
fuller and more accurate, as I believe, than that of previous
editors. Mr. Walker also read my Commentary, both in
MS. and in proof‚ and his wide knowledge of Astrology
has been of great service to me. Prof. D. A. Slater
read my Translation, and made many valuable criticisms.
Pros. J. S. Phillimore supplied me with a number of
parallels between the language of Manilius and that of
Propertius. To Dr. J. K. Fotheringham I am indebted for
information upon Roman Chronology; and to my col-
leagues Mr. A. L. Dixon and Mr. E. W. B. Gill for
assistance in Astronomy. Mr. Bywater helped me every-
where, always ungrudging of his time, and always ready
with sympathetic counsel. Indeed, there is no part of this
book (save its faults) which does not owe something to him.
