INTRODUCTION I

expect Statius to begin at 60 r : as a matter of fact it begins at 64 r,
four folios being left vacant. Now these four vacant folios are of
different paper from the rest ofM. Foll. 68—1 15, on which Statius
is written, form four seniones ; but 60-7 form what may be called
a sbam qualerm'on. If this quaternion is examined, it will be
discovered that foll. 64—7 originally formed part of a senio:
fol. 64 is actually numbered ‘9 ' : it is page 9 osa senio of which
the first 8 folios have disappeared 3 and, in the place of these
8 folios of a senio, 8 pages (4 folios) of quite a different paper
have been glued on to foll. 64—7‚ to keep these leaves together;
and the senio has thus been converted into a quaterni0n‚ or rather
into two sets of four folios. Really, therefore, there are missing
before foll. 64-7 eight folios of a senio. Now Manilius occupies
5 seniones¹: Statius, 5 seniones minus 8 folios. From between
the two there have been lost x seniones² -4- 8 folios. T hielscher
ponus outthat st you take Sssnffi Itahcus‚countthe fines and
anangetheniin pages<ss 40 hnes each (std'has 40 finesto the
page) you will get 12 seniones -ι- 8 folios3 and remembering how,
in the Poggian literature, Manilius, Siluae, and Silius are in-
separably associated, he conjectures that M at one time contained
also Silius Italicus.3

Ι have no doubt whateverthat ssus conynnureis a true one,
and it constitutes an important addition to our knowledge of M.
It carries us beyond M. In the periodica] Serapeum in 1840
there was published a transcript of a ninth-century library cata-
logue which was then in possession of a German scholar, Lassberg.
This was supposed, on its first publication, to be the catalogue
either of the Cathedral Library at Constance or of the St. Gall
monastery. Since then H. Blass has pointed out that it cannot
have come from either of these two libraries <though Manitius
still speaks of it as the Constance Catalogue), nor again from the
neighbouring library of Reichenau. However this may be, certain
feaunes of st senffito connectit wsth the nfflghbourhood of
St. Gall and Constance. Now one of the entries in this catalogue
speaks ofa MS. of ‘ Ouidii metamorfoseon. Sili et Stacii uolumen '.
‘ Stacii' is commonly referred to Thebais or Achilleis, but 1 have
no doubt that this reference is false. From a fairly extensive
acquaintance with the MSS. of Thebais and Achilleis, extant or

¹ The first leaf is, however, missing.

² Thielscher has unfortunately made his calculations almost meaningless
by printing ¹ x seniones’ for ‘x seniones ⁷. 1t took me a week to discover
that ‘x seniones⁷ stood not for ‘ 10 seniones' but for an unknown quantity
of seniones.

³ Clark, on the other hand writes, in C. R„ 1899, p. 127, ‘It is not likely
that Manilius and the siluae were found in one MS. together with Silius
Italicus.y
