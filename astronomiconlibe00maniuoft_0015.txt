PREFACE

enthusiasms or in his dislikes—wished that Manilius might
be read in all the schools. Milton in his treatise Os
Education seems to have entertained the same wish. For
myself,I wish Manilius no such doubtful fortune. Yet Ι
do greatly desiderate the teaching in the schools of some-
thing that used to be taught there, of something that would
make the reading of Manilius easier for the average
student—I mean what our grandparents called ‘the use of
the globes’. In an age which seems to be moving in-
evitably to the depressing ideal of ‘secular education ', it
might yet be possible, by teaching the elements of Astro-
nomy, to keep imagination still alive in the land. I have
two celestial globes before me as I write. The first I
acquired easily, since it is a hundred years old, and a
century ago celestia] globes were common objects. The
second, which is a modern one, was ordered for me in
London, and took a month to procure. That such a thing
should be wanted at all was a portent3 and the salesman
gravely inquired os me whether Ι wished it ‘coloured
politically '. Sic etiam magno quaedam respublica mzmdo
est! Thus do our political animosities taint even the
citizenship of heaven, and there survives in our great
statesmen after their merited cata-sterism the passion for
painting red the map of the universe.

This volume, 1 should say finally, is an enlargement of
a special course of lectures delivered in Michaelmas Term,
1909, under the auspices of the Common University Fund.
Ι have to express my gratitude to the Delegates of that
F und for the opportunity thus afforded to me of devoting
myself with an unembarrassed conscience to a subject
which lies so much outside the routine of our ordinary
studies here. It is possible, of course, to stray both too
long and too far from the beaten track. The complaint of
time wasted upon ‘second-rate authors’ has often a good
deal of justice in it. Yet, on the whole, the more common
fault is to indulge too little in ourselves, and to stimulate
too little in others, that curiosity which is the necessary

relish of all study. Nor would I submit to rank Manilius
