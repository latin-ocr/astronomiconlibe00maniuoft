ASTRONOMICON II

other signs rise upright. So marvel not at the sun's tarrying
in summer, seeing that the signs through which with
dragging months he bears up the summer part of our year
rise with their hinder parts.

Ornit not to note clearly and to deduce by true rule what
signs are nocturnal, what diurnal. They are not those that
accomplish their task by night and those that accomplish
it by day. For in that case there would be no distinction
of name, seeing that the signs shine in ordered succession
to one another through all the hours‚ [some of thern follow-
ing upon the day some upon the night] But nocturnal
and diurnal signs are so according as Nature, the mighty
parent of the universe, has assigned to them a sacred
portion of time and a fixed place for ever in the heavens.
The sign of the Archer and of the fierce Lion, the Ram
that looks round ever to the golden fleece upon his back,
the Fishes, the Crab, and the Scorpion of savage tooth‚are
all of them either pairs or else separated from one another
by equal distances. And therefore all of them are called
from this likeness diurnal signs. The other signs, which
are like the diurnal signs in that they are numerically pairs
and like thern in that in position they are alternate pairs,
⁴ fill the gaps left by the six diurnal signs: and are called
nocturnal. Note further, that some have assigned the
character of diurnal signs to the six consecutive signs,
beginning with the Ram, the chief of all. The six signs
beginning with the Claws they bid us regard as the
nocturnal signs. Others again hold that the diurnal signs
are the male signs. The female signs love the darkness
which covers the deeds of night.

Some signs again proclaim without interpreter that they
owe their origin to Neptune. The Crab towering up like
a rock out of the sea, the Fishes revelling in the water
which the Waterman pours for them. Some signs are
accounted as of terrene nature—the Bun, prince of the
herd‚ the Ram rejoicing in his lordship over the wool-
bearing flock; the bane and despoiler of them both, the
Lion3 and the Scorpion that haunts the thicket of the
field. There are also signs of middle condition belonging
to a mixed dispensation‚ Capricorn that seems doubtfully
to belong to earth, Aquarius a suspect denizen os the
