ΙΙ 203—24 COMMENTARY

p. 155, ἡμέρη μὲν γὰρ καὶ νύξ, ὡς φησὶ Ποσειδώνιος, ἀρτίου καὶ περιττοῦ
φύσιν ἔχουσι. Breiter quotes this excerpt from Bouche-Leclercq, but
he omits to note the opposition here between Manilius and his ‘ source ’.
The scheme which Manilius himself adopts is apparently determined
for him by the doctrine of triangular affinities—which the reader has
here to presuppose, since it is not adumbrated until 270 sqq. The
scheme incidentally involves Manilius in the difficulty that each pair is
composed of different sexes, which are eo ῥύεο antipathetic (see 38 5—90).
The scheme mentioned at 218—20 is Alexandrian. ‘ Les Alexandrins qui
firent parler Nechepso et Petosiris purent invoquer la vieille tradition
egyptienne‚ qui adjugeait une moitie du ciel aux heures du jour et
a leurs divinites protectrices, l’autre moitie: aux heures et divinites de
la nuit‚’ Bouche-Leclercq, pp. 155-6. For the inconveniences of this
scheme, and sor the reformed scheme of Ptolemy see Bouche-Leclercq‚
pp. 156-7.

205. peragentia sortem: modellecl on such phrases as peragere
uices (Ovid Met. xv, 238), peragere noctem (noctem, the Cusanus here)
Ovid Am. I. ii. 3. Cf. Ovid Met. xiii. 618 sol duodena peregit szjgrna.

206. nam : ‘for in that case.’

211. Sagittari: Bentley noted that Manilius never, save at ii. 740
in the Greek word dodecatemorii, employs the uncontracted form -ii
for the genitive of nouns in -ius, -z'um3 see 232, 280, 484, 505, 560,
569. Bentley took this as an indication that Manilius was not post-
Augustan. But the same reasoning would conduct us to the view that
Persius was not post-Augustan‚ for he also eschews the genitive in -z'i.
Slee Cramer Man. El„ pp. 5—6‚ n. 1 (and Lachm. Lacr„ p. 325). Cf.
a so on o.

rabidique: ‘rapidique durch L and M empsohlen,’ Breiter; in
which case L and M will serve to ‘empsehlen ' anything. ita semper
peccatur pro rabidi, Scaliger, truly, at 550.

216. nec numero dissortia nec uice sedis: non numero dissortia
because, like the diurna, they are pairs3 non uice sedis dissortia
because, like the diurna, they are alternate pairs. This seems quite
clear, though Bentley professes himself unable to understand either
numero or zcz'cc sedis.

I have accepted Ellis' dissortia for MSS. consortia. The only
alternative would be to receive Breiter’s amne . . . nunc for nec . . . nec,
retaining consortia. Breiter’s previous uel . . . uel is clearly inferior.

217. interiecta locis totidem : locis totidem together3 ‘ fitted into
as many gaps,’ i. e. fitted into the six places (or three double-places)
left vacant by the diurna.

219. astris: castra illa frustra tuelur Scalzjger, Bentley, truly.

220. Chelis: so Bentley for libris of GL (= st is); M has libra;
‘ damit ist Bentley's Chelis beseitigt,’ says Breiter. Far from it 3 and in
reviewing Breiter's text I praised the scholarly sense which led him to
retain Chelis despite M; but I now find that he retained it not on his
own judgement but on that of the printer. libra is no doubt merely an
intelligent emendation of libris. Given libris one can explain libra3
given libra one cannot explain libris.

222. in noctem tutis together (noctem = libsdz‘nem): so Jacob;
but the text is pretty certainly corrupt.

223—33. Szgrna (1) Mariua: Cancer, Pisces; (2) Terrena: Aries,
Taurus, Scorpion, Leo 3 (3) Ambigua: Capricorn, Aquarius.

224. scopulosus: Bentley's populosus (a late word at best ; add to
L. ἃ S„ Nemesianus Cyn. 136 populosas pascere setus3 Ainmlan.
