MANILIUS AND HIS EDITORS

parallels enables students for the first time to set Manilius in true
relation to the literature of his age. To Cramer’s paper ‘Der
Infinitiv bei Manilius' in Commentationes in Honorem Gulielmi
Studemund (Strasburg, 1889, pp. 61—75) I owe some references at
270 and 816-19. The same scholar's laborious essay upon the
earliest editions of Manilius (Ueher die c‘z‘ltesteu Ausgaben der
Astronomica des M, Ratisbon‚ 1 904) is an indispensable work for any
one trying to find his way among the early printed copies of the
Astronomica.¹ Indeed, so far as Ι know, Cramer has written nothing
upon Manilius that does not repay reading. Lanson's brochure,
which 1 have just mentioned, appeared in Paris in 1887. Itis rc-
viewed by M. Cartault in Rev. Crit„ No. 15, 1888. Lanson holds
that Manilius I—III was written after the clades Variana, but be-
fore Ovid's Pontica. IV—V he thinks Subsequent to the Pontica
(cf. Cramer, lisam. El„ p. 4). Cartault's view is not essentially
different. Ι am not sure that arguments from the Pontica have
much value. The coincidence Pons. iv, 4. 41 ‘toto comitante
senatu ² = Man. IV. 60 ‘toto spectante senatu’ may be mere coin-
cidence. Lanson thinks, with Bentley, that Manilius was of
ῃ Asiatic nationality: see below, of Kraemer.² His contentiori
(chap. ii) that Manilius was not a Stoic‚ I think paradoxical.
(Si quis autem carmen penitus uniuersumque considerauerit
minime Stoicum fuisse Manilium fatebitur, etsi interdum Stoice
locutus est‚' p. 39.) Yet it is perhaps a useful corrective to what
I may call the Posidonian theory (see below, of Mueller), and I can
sympathize heartily with M. Lanson when he urges (p. 53) that
Manilius is a poet and an astrologer first and anything else only
in a secondary sense. On the literary qualities of Manilius
(chaps. iv—v) Lanson speaks with the grace and good sense usual
to French scholars. In the same year to which Lanson's essay
belongs P. Thomas published at Ghent his Luc-abraames?
valuable for its accurate collation of the Gemblacensis. The
sanie writer's Noles et Cousectures sm* Manilius appeared (also at
Ghent) in 1893. Ι am glad to find Thomas praising the ‘livre

¹ The opinions which 1 have offered upon pp. lxxv sqq. are, however,

independent of Cra1ner3 but sor my data 1 have not gone much outside
Book 11.

² Lanson infers that Manilius was born in Asia from the geography os
Book IV.

arc, 1 think, true (23, 226).
