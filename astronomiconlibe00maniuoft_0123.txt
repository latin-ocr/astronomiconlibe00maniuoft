waters. [The first degree of the Water-carrier ever pouring
water is hurtfuL] In these the elements of water and earth
are mixed in equable distribution.

We must not turn our minds away even from things of
least note. Nothing is without reason, nor in vain created.
The Crab and his kind are, as in their own right, prolific;
so also the fierce Scorpion and the Fishes whose spawn
fills the sea. But the Maid is sterile, and next neighbour
to a sterile Lion: nor does the Water-carrier receive seed
into him, nor bring forth. Midway between the two estates
is the twynformed Capricorn and the Centaur with his
shining Cretan bow. The Ram, too, is of the middle con-
dition, and he counts as partners in his lot the Balance that
weighs evenly the seasons‚ the Twins, the Bull.

Dream not that it is without contrivance of nature that
some signs are runners—as the Lion‚ the Archer‚ and the
Ram that twists his neck on to his horns: that some stand
straight-poised on steady limbs, as the Madd, the Twins,
and the Water—carrier with his pot ; that some sit in weary
postme, the reflex osa tired mind,—as the Bull that, relieved
of the plough, disposes his neck to sleep, the Balance that
sinks down having discharged the cycle of his tasks,
Capricorn that huddles himself frozenly together with all
his stars ; that others, again, lie down,—as the Crab sprawling
with distended belly‚ the Scorpion dropping down on the
earth and resting his smooth front upon it, the Fishes
swimming slant-wise, ever prone.

Again, if you survey all the signs with wise industry, you
will find stars that are maimed and have lost this or that
limb. The Scorpion has lost his claws in the Balance, the
Bull sinks down lame with crooked leg, no eyes has the
Crab, one eye has the Centaur still but one he has lost.
So does the universe, by showing us the stars, console our
ills, and by heavenly example teach us patiently to bear
our earthly losses. For all the order of our fortunes is
dependent on the skies, and the very stars themselves have
bodies misshapen and warped.

The signs also have their proper seasons wherein they
hold sway. Summer begins with the Twins, autumn with
