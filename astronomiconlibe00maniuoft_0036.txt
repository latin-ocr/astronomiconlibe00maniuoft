INTRODUCTION I

error, as e. g. IV. 282 lucc calzgt’nem, this agreement can only be
explained by supposing that their reading is that of the archetype
of all our MSS., Α. Whence then has G acquired in all these
places—and I could multiply the number of them infinitely—the
true reading? In some cases no doubt its true reading may be
due to conjecture —for it is, as Thielscher perceives, a deeply
interpolated MS. But in many cases it is impossible to explain
these true readings as conjectures. And the only other explanation
is that where G alone has the true reading it has somehow or other
gone behind A, behind the archetype of GLM. When at IV. 282
LM have huc callgineon), the reading of A was undoubtedly lzuc
calzgrine ; and lzztc calzgim? must also have been the reading of the
common parent (α) of GL. The many places where G diverges
from Α and α, therefore, and offers instead a true reading, can
only be explained by assuming that G, or the MS. from which it
is immediately copied, has been corrected from some purer and
probably older source than A. And that this has happened is
most clearly seen when we observe that in many of its true
readings G is supported by L² (as ΙΙ. 584, IV. 221 in the readings
given above). G and L, the former in countless places, the latter
in a few, have been corrected from a MS. of Manilius better than
any known to us.¹

¹ Thielscher’s position is based upon two assumptions: (ι) that L was
written before G : but here the evidence does no more than at most to show
that L is probably not later than G ; (2) that, where G has in its text the read-
ings of the corrector of L, it depends for those readings actually upon L. At
the best this could be only a likely presumption. But this presumption is
rendered very weak indeed by (1) the number of true readings peculiar to
G; (2) the agreements between G and the Codex Venetus, os which Ι give
an account in Introduction, 11, pp. xlvii sqq. How will Thielscher explain
the fact that, to take one example, at 820 G Ven. have cordibus, L has
torridus? (3) by the frequent disagreement of G and the corrector
of L. It is perhaps worth while to note here some places where G
does not offer the correction which stands in L. I. 130 *sumptum L2:
