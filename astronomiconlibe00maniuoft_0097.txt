MANILIUS AND HIS EDITORS

years later Richter sent Bentley a collation of L. Bentley already
had one in 1693 3 and, save that 116 may have revised its readings
by the aid of this new one, there is nothing to show that 116 did
anything at all to Manilius after 1699. When the work finally
appeared, the Praefatio contained misstatements¹ which Bentley
should long ago have made impossible. And in the preparation
of his text also his laziness is apparent. He collated G himself,
yet 116 merely quotes it at his convenience; and his Apparatus
exhibits merely variants from Scaliger's edition. For the other
MSS. which he employs he depended upon the labours of other
scholars. Those which he knew at first hand were such thata few
hours' work at each would be sufficient to show their small value
to so skilled a critic. Indeed, he says frankly to Bernard that he
wants a collation of Codex Pitlzoei just in order to impress the

those lesser labours of scholarship which are the true touchstone
of devotion. If out of the thirty years during which the Manilius
lay idle Bentley had given one to the serious revision of it 116
would have made his work twice as good as it is.
ῃ ‘ Dictator Britannus ³ is the ill-natured but not undeserved title
by which Stoeber (who in 1767 appended to K'onig's reprint of
Bentley’s text his own commentary upon it) alludes to Bentley.
Konig had intended to print merely Bentley’s text. Stoeber
adjured him not to give this to the world unaccompanied by the
notes of some learned man. ‘Placuit consilium,’ says Stoeber
modestly: Konig commissioned 81061161 10 supply these notes.
The commission was given to a man who undoubtedly was learned.
But Stoeber's much learning would truly seem to have affected
him in the proverbial way. When Ι read Mr. Housman's estimato
of him, Ι thought that probably, like so many of Mr. Housman's
judgements, it was too highly coloured. But 1 have had Stoeber
constantly by me for a long time, and Ι have read all his notes
upon Book II. I can only say that his work seems to me to 116
scarcely that of a sane man. One reads a line or two of some
criticism of Bentley's text, and one says at once, ‘ Oh, but he cannot
have read Bentley⁷s note.' But in the very next line he betrays,
by borrowing something from it, that he has done so. Such men
