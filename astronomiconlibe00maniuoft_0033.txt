THE THREE PRINCIPAL MSS.

nitumque M, quod sic correxi: totumque GL. (A had tbitum
no doubt.)

All these examples are from places where M furnishes us either
with a uox nihili, or with a word, Latin indeed, but in the context,
meaningless. Yet in each case the reading is more ‘sincere’ than
that of the other MSS„ and the further removed it is from correct-
ness the nearer is it to truth. But the superiority of M to all
other MSS. does not lie merely in its blunders. In innumerable
places it is right, or nearly right, against all the MSS. Let any
one turn to Mr. Housman's tables of excellences (pp. xxiv—
xxvi). Let him remember that where, on p. xxiv, Mr. Hous-
man says β, we may now safely say M ε for all β is All. He
will then find that the passages where M (= Mss) excels G fill
a much longer column than do the passages where the converse
occurs. But Mr. Housman's lists do not pretend to any com-
pleteness‚ and they are also designed to show that G and M are
equal. Let me therefore put before the reader a list of places
where M is right—or nearly so—-which shall be, so far as it goes,
rather more complete. I say ⁶ so far as it goes ⁷ 3 for I shall con-
fine myself to a single book. Ι select Book III merely for the

‚ reason that it follows Book II. A list from any other book would

yield similar results 3 and any one can make these lists for himself.
Here, then, are some places in Book III where I think the reading
of M truer than that of GL.

22 magni M: magno GL. 23 sint acta M ; sit acta L: si
facta G.¹ 52 flammamque M: flammam GL. 89 utcunque M:
ut fit cum G z ut cum L. 132 gnatorum] gratorum M: fatorum
GL. 177 duplici M: duplicem GL. 200 fulgens M: om. GL.
265 ibi M: ubi GL. 271 demum M: demum est GL. 283
gelidas uergentia] gelida uergentia M: gelidasque rigentia GL.
292 cadendi M : canendi GL. 297 signa M ε signis GL.
325 fastigia M: uestigia GL. 328 condesque] scandesque M:
scandensque GL. 332 limite recto] limitet octo All z limitet octo
L: limitis octo G. 337 iam M: nam L : nec G. 345 oculos M:
oculis GL. 359 prona M: prima L¹G¹. 362 patebunt M:

¹ This is one osa number of passages where L is in sincerity superior to
G. Others are—From Book I: 229 toto· 745 reserentia. In Book 111 ;
332 limitet-⁷ 337 nam. 420 demit. 604 form-{i et. 680 quidem. In Book
IV: regni] regi L: rei G. Yet occasionally L will be found less sincere
than either G or M; >e. g. 11. 495 in mutua G : in muta M: immutaque L.
