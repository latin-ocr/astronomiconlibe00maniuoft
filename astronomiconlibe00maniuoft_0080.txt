INTRODUCTION ΙΙΙ

a poet, though sometimes it seems to. Nor can mere grace, mere
charm. Manilius has a moral elevation, a pure intensity of ,
philosophie feeling, which places him by the side of Lucretius. l
And he has in addition a grace and charm, a fluency and limpidity l¹
of style, which brings him near to Ovid.¹ T he Lucretian and the ⁴¹
Ovidian manners in him are not of course equably fused, nor is
such a fusion possible; nor, indeed, is the poem of Manilius as
a whole a fused or even work. The greatest passages in the poem
are those in which the Lucretian manner triumphs over the ‘¹
Ovidian: for the latter, or something like it, is Manilius’ normal
manner. Even in these passages a certain affectation, a love os
the antithetic, a straining after ‘point ³, reminds us that an im-
perial language has already submitted itself to mere cleverness ;
though perhaps it does not seem to us, as it seems to us always
when reading Ovid, that the author himself is trying to be elever.
But if Manilius is a great poet by his Lucretian passages, he is
none the less at his more normal level mostly pleasing and grace-
ful. The purity of his Latin style, though some critics have found
his accents Punic, has been admitted by most scholars. And in
numberless passages of the fourth and fifth books, where there is
no great intensity of feeling, where the writing is removed from all
suspicion of greatneSS, Manilius has an ease and grace and clear-
ness quite admirable and in some respects unique. If it is the
Lucretian hair-shirt showing out beneath the Ovidian fine clothes
which touches us most nearly, yet the fine clothes (and they are
less fine than Ovid's, after all, more simply carried, and with
fewer ribbons and bows) are well worth observation. Or to put
all this differently, every now and again we get from Manilius
really great literature, and very frequently the sort of literature
which may be called the ne plus ultra of ‘ pleasant reading '.²

But it is beside my purpose to speak here either of the philo-
sophy or of the style of Manilius. Ι have only said so much
in order to show how a poem, of which the subject is to modern
ideas so repellent and vain, may yet be worth study. And indeed,
though students of Manilius are few, not many Latin poets have
been thought worth study by so many scholars of eminent talents.
