MANILIUS AND HIS EDITORS

80). ε consists of ed. Bononiensis, Bonincontrius‚ Dulcinius
(1489), and the first Aldine (1499). (To the same group belong
in the next century ed. Rom.‚ Priickner, Molinius.) The first
Naples edition is not much better than a reprint of Regio—
montanus, embodying a certain number of corrections derived
from ed. Bononiensis. Its chief importance is that through it
the text of Regiomontanus was propagated into texts whose
editors did not have direct access to the editio princeps. The
quarto edition sine loco et amm follows very closely the first
Neapolitan, but again and again crosses over into the ε tradition.
The editor may be allowed to possess more judgement than any
of his three predecessors.¹ Once or twice he gives us what I take
to be a true conjectural emendation, e. g. ΙΙ. 334 ‘partibus aut
trinis '.

But Regiomontanus, ed. Bononiensis, the Naples editions. the
sine loco et anno are, when all is said and done, alike bad and
dull. A little life and colour comes into the editing of Manilius
first with Bonincontrius (1484). Judged by any reasonable
standard even this edition is an incompetent work. Scaliger is
not too severe upon the faults of Bonincontrius. Yet, after all,
this muddled and superstitious man is the first editor of Manilius
who appears in any degree, Ι will not say rational but, human.
Little as we know of him, his personality is not uninteresting:
and his writings are, at any rate, some expression of himself. He
was born in 1410 at San Minimo, of an ancient family, which had
sustained some part in Florentine affairs. As a young man he
became mixed up in some treasonable negotiations with the
Emperor Sigismund‚ and was banished from his native city.
Later he saw some dangerous soldiering under Francesco Sforza,
Duke of Milan, and the last three decades of a long life (he died
not long after 1494—the date of his Fasti) he spent as astrologer—
in-ordinary at the Court of Naples. He is drawn to Manilius by
his own experience‚ through a life of many vicissitudeS‚ of the
truth of the starS. Commenting upon ΙΙ. 872 he writes: ‘praeceps]
agit homines in praecipitium: expertus loquor qui habui Martem
in hac domo et amisi omnia bona et patriam, exulque XLV annis
aberraui a Miniati oppido.' ² And again, ΙΙ. 885 : ‘quod ego sum

¹ 1 have little doubt that he is prior to Bonincontrius.
