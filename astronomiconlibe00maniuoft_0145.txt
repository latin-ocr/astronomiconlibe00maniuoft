ASTRONOMICON II

Twins, by those born under the Maid, by those that are of
the lineage of the Archer.

Nor is this the only cause which assigns enmities to men
at their birth, and begets a race set upon hate and war with
its neighbour53 but mostly alternate signs are by unkind
law for ever doomed fixedly to behold one another with
wrathful sidelong looks: for when any two signs are estab-
lished in diametrically opposed places and, with five stars
intervening, advance contrasted fmnts, the signs which are
separated by one from either of thern form a triangle with
the other. So that one need not be surprised if peace
does not exist between stars that are connected with the
signs of an opposed triangle.

As often as men are born hostile to one another, they
come into the world opposed one to the other owing to these
configurations of signs and in these combinations. There-
fore it is that nature has created out of herself nothing
greater ever nor more rare than the heart of friendship.
There was never but one Pylades, and but one Orestes
fain to die for his friend. Once only in the world's ages
have men striven at law for the possession of death
[when the one snatched at that prize of death which the
· other would not yield. Two only have availed to follow
them. Scarce could Punishment find gunt] Once only
has ever surety prayed that the accused might fail to return,
once only has the accused seared lest his surety should
make him free. Through all the periods of man’s life, all
generations, all years, amid wars and amid the motley strife
even of peace, when uncertain Fortune seeks certain F a1th
scarce does she find it in the wide world. Yet how great in all'
the ages is the sum of crime, how great a load of guilt not
to be put aside lies on the earth. <Why shouldb I tell of
brothers stained with brothers’ blood), of fathers murdered
for money, and the deaths of mothers? <Why shouldI
tell how of old> Phoebus brought (sudden) night <on
a world of men accursed>, and fied from earth? Why tell
of cities overturned‚ temples betrayed, a thousand disasters
breaking man's peace, the mixing of poisonS‚ plottings in
the market-place, slaughter within the very walls of Rome,
and bands that in the name of comradeship work riot?
