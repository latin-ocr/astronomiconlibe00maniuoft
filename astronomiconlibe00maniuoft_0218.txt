11 453-66 COMMENTARY

Housman, despairing of the passage (perhaps justly)‚ suggests
ingeniously szngulaque imperiis proprzis pc'zrenlza membra (piis of

impiis ·(= zmpe7 iis) dropped out before fprz'zs (= propriis), and figuris
came in as a metrical stop- -.gap) The antecedent to quis will then,
1 suppose, be sidera
[Ι append, for 454— 6, the renderings of Du Fay and Pingre'. atquae

szngula membrz exeuent suas p ’'cultares uires ex toto suo corpore,
Du F ay et la de‘p ndance οτι est chaque membre de son propre signe,
qni de'ploze pricnczpzlement sur lui toute l'e'nergze de son pouv0i,r
Pin re.

4.ξὸ ]Aries caput est: in the Astrologzcal Catalogue‚ vi, p. 83, Aries
is actually the head, as Pisces the feet, of the Cosmos.

457. Tauri. a ‘b’ull’ s· -neck is proverbial.

458-9. in geminos scribuntur: cf. on 268. Bracchia and umerz
go to Gemini because there are two of each.

459. pectus· . the breast belongs to Cancer because of the testudo·
like formation of the ribs.

460. laterum regnum: cf. Catull. lxiii. 81 age caede terga cauda,
tua uerbera patere. The characteristic action of the lion is latera, or
terga, uerberare.

461. descendunt: Bentley’ s concedunt, Housman' s discedunt seem
unnecessary (and, with accedunt 463, even clumsy); Manilius is going
down the body and down the list of signs.

The want of fitness with which the ilia are assigned to Virgo was
early commented upon; cf. Bouche- -Leclercq, p. 319 n.

463. acgeduntz‘ ‘sue to‚' as inferiors approach a superior or
master3 cf. regnum (460) tmperitat (464), arbi'trzum (465), tura (ib.).

464. imperitat: so Bentley for tmperat et MSS. (tmperandz for
2⁰77zperi3tandz Tacitus stt. i. 52. 10, ef. Fisher ad loc.; negitatque -ι-
negat atque, MSS. Hor. Epi.st i. 16. 49). Ellis (proposing tmperat in)
urges that Manilius avoids frequentatives. This, as has been pointed out
by Bitterauf, is hardly correct. Among examples given by Bitterauf,

crurum: i. e. tibiarum.
fundentis: absolutely, as in the doubtful example at 232; but
not elsewhere.

466-519. Certain signs have friendships, &c., among themselves
quite independent of the relationship arising out of their membership
of a common triangle‚ quadrangle‚ ἃς. (i. e. quite independent of all
that has been noted in 297—432). They gaze at, listen to, love one
another, just because God when he ordered the mundus so directed
their eyes, ears, hearts- even as rnen love one another and know not
wh

y The astrologers recognized two kinds of association among signs.
(ι) polygonal association; (2) parallel association. Of (1) Manilius
has spoken in 297 sqq. The governing principle of (2 2) is fairly simple.
Signs situated in the same parallel are related; they are gu ζυγα or
ὁμόζωνα. (a) When they are situated on lines parallel to the axis of
the equinoxes they are said to see one another, to be βλέποντας when
they are situated on lines parallel to the axis of the solstices they are
said to hear one another, to be ἀκούοντα, ὑπακούοντα. That is, signs of
