INTRODUCTION 1

And if this hypothesis is correct, what more likely than that
Manilius and the siluae, which are found together in M, stood
together in the codex found by Poggio in Constance?

There would seem then to be external grounds for believing
that M stands far nearer to the archetype than GL. Does the
interna] evidence, the evidence of its readings, confirm it in that
superiority to which this external circumstance might naturally
entitle it?

Poggio ¹ speaks of the scribe of M as ‘ ignorantissimus omnium
viventium '-a phrase for which we can guess the English equiva-
lent. Poggio was perhaps a somewhat exacting and fastidious
employer.'² Yet the scribe of M was undoubtedly a person of
very inadequate scholarship. On the other hand he was pains-
taking and unambitious‚ and utterly honest. And it is because
of this utter honesty of its scribe that M is, on the whole, a far
more faithful representative of A than either G or L. Not only
has it, in innumerable places, preserved the true reading where GL
have a false reading3 but—more important—in innumerable
places where GL have a specious and passable reading, M has
something which, if it is corrupt and absurd in itself‚ yet points us
to the true text. Its strength is made perfect in weakness. Out
of its foolishness criticism has ordained wisdom.

This is what Mr. Housman means when he says that the
family of M is ‘less correct ³, that of GL ‘less sincere'. Why
having said this he yet says, ‘Let us hear no talk of the better
family of MSS„ for nothing of that name exists ’, I do not know.
It may be that he hates some unnamed critic more than he loves
consistency. For the ‘ more sincere' family is and must be for
any critic who understands his business ‘the better family ’. One
can, of course, go too far: one can make of M a veritable spoilt
child3 and indeed there would be some excuse—so irritatingly
respectable is G in comparison. But when all is said and done,
while any moderately competent person can construet out of GL

or badly frayed, in such a way that the first leaf showed through its lacunae
the readings, at a particular point, of the leaf following. In the case of
v. 1. 81 this explanation will, 1 think, be admitted to work much better than
that of Krohn (which fails to satissy Klotz). See Klotz, Praefi, p. lxxv, 1900.
It should be noticed, in support of it, that the damage at v. 1. 81 has, as
Klotz remarks, extended to v. 1. 82—4.
