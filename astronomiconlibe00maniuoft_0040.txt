INTRODUCTION Ι

distuleris in hiemem.' It is quite clear that he wants his MS.
not to keep but to copy. Similarly elsewhere he tells Nicolaus
that if he will only return Lucretius, so that he (Poggio) may
copy it, Nicolaus may then keep it as long as he likes. It would
be strange if when he finally got Asconius and Valerius he did
not after all copy them. And if he did copy thern, surely it is
more reasonable to identify P with this later fair copy than with
the Constance rough draft.

Let us see how all this afsects M, which Clark holds to be the
copy written for Poggio in Constance by a German scribe, and
sent to Barbaro¹—to be forwarded to Nicolaus. On p. 303 of
Tonelli we find Poggio asking Nicolaus not only for Asconius
but, inter alia, sor Statius' Siluae also. He seems to have got
this, and indeed all his MSS.‚ by the year 1430—or earlier. For
on September 3 of that year he writes to Nicolaus that the only
book which he still wants is the Pliny which Leonardo has
(p. 321). If he received the Sullae, then <i.e. the Barbaro copy),
about 1430, may we not suppose that he had it transcribed? We
knowthatabout1426 heluulacquned.a Gassnzscnbeto whoni
he taught ‘litterae antiquae ², i.e. the Italian book-hand of saec. xv
modelled on the tenth-century Caroline (p. 176, Tonelli). Is not
M just such a script as we might expect from such a scribe—the
script of a Gallic scribe trying to write ‘litterae antiquae'?

This scribe is twice mentioned (pp. 155, 160 Tonelli). He is
a good writer who writes characters ‘quae sapiunt antiquitatem ',
though it has been a long business to perfect him (edocui, p. 160).
Incidentally his morals are thoroughly disreputable.

Be the morals of this scribe what they may, it is nevertheless
not possible to identify him with the scribe of M. The scribe
of M is the kind of scribe who could by no possibility have found,
let alone retained, a place in Poggio's familia. His writing is not
‘good' but bad, and his ignorance of Latin is overwhelming.
Such a scribe might do, in default of better, for a transcript made
hurriedly in Constance. But it is unthinkable that Poggio should
have entrusted the fair and final copying of his Constance tran-
script to so incompetent a copyist.2 On the other hand the scribe
of M answers admirably to the description which Poggio gives of

¹ Whether Poggio is in Constance or in England everything goes to
Nicolaus via Barbaro. This is because Barbaro was in Venice, and letters,
δία, followed the great trade route by way of Innsbruck. Even from Eng-
land the trade route was largely overland: Poggio’s mail would not go
direct by sea to Venice. Poggio sometimes sends letters via Pisa : this also
was an important post town. In any case foreign letters sor Florence
would naturally be directed in the first instance to some reliable person in
Venice.

² See, however, Engelmann, De Stati Siluarum Codicibus (Leipsie, 1902),
ρρ. 25 sqq. Engelmann takes Poggio's grumblings too much au pied de Ia
lettre; and Epp. i. 2-29 really tells against his position. ν
