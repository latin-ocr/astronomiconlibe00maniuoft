PREFACE

to compare him with, and make him conform to, his sup-
posed sources. And my notes are to some extent a protest
against the modern κακόηθες of Quellenforsclzmtg. At the
same time Ι have tried to give the reader some notion of
the relation in which, in perplexed passages, Manilius
stands to our other authorities. This has occasionally
compelled me to notes of a length so considerable that an
Excursus might be thought to have been more desirable.
On the whole, however, Ι have thought it well to deal with
difficulties as they arose. The practical discomfort of a
Commentary in which the principal difficulties are always
waiting round the corner seems to me greater than the
moderate annoyance of a disproportion in the notes. And
in this matter I am in agreement with the practice of
previous editors of Manilius. Those passages, I may add,
from other authors, whether Greek or Latin, by which I
have tried to illustrate either the thought or the language
of Manilius, are in the main my own collection. Where

” Ι have cited a passage already adduced by some previous

editor 1 have usually noted that fact. In interpretation it
will be found that Ι have in a great many passages been
compelled to take a different view from that commonly
received. 1 have not done this rashly ; and I do not need
to be told that one should think twice before one disagrees
with Scaliger. But it would, I think, argue an inert mind
if after four years' study of an author whose subject and
style are alike so difficult, I had not found in several
passages something to offer which Ι thought was truer
than what had been said upon them previously.

Hauptl has remarked truly that the text of Manilius
is more corrupt than that of almost any ancient author.
Owing to the fact that my text is accompanied by a trans-
lation I have been obliged constantly‚ in framing it, to
come to a definite decision at places where, if I were not
translating, I should have preferred to place an obelus. ln
my Apparatus Criticus Ι have recorded only the readings of
