These gaps should mean that Ven. was copied from a codex
which was, where they occur, illegible. This is important as
indicating (1) that Ven.'s original was probably a MS. of some
antiquity 3 (2) that its original was no one of the codices known to
us ; (3) that Ven. itself perished without progeny. (2) and (3) are
further supported by the fact that Ven„ besides omitting the lines
omitted by GL, omits also the whole of IV. 298 (ut ex Bentleii
notis uidetur), IV. 367, IV. 422, V. 465.

One or two readings not in themselves intelligible are worth
pondering, as IV. 644 suam (for potius), V. 322 manibus for urbis
(uerbis). It is also worth noticing that certain of the readings of
Ven. reappear in V ³; e. g. I. 13 altum, Ι. 629 aeterna. . . sede
(so M), Ι. 81 1 euentus, ΙΙ. 29 solantemque: V³ is perhaps
a descendant of C revised by the aid of Ven.

Of this codex as a whole I should be inclined to say that it
affords an interesting illustration of the vanity of so many of our
palaeographical inferences. It is an early MS„ perhaps as old as
any that we have. Yet it has already suffered interpolation serious
both in quantity and quality. It is the only MS. of the Belgian
family which can safely be pronounced independent of GL, and
from this independence we might well have hoped much. Yet it
clears up no single desperate passage. Of its new readings those
that are true lie under the suspicion of conjecture. And, speaking
generally, its chief importance consists in the proof it affords that
a not inconsiderable number of readings hitherto thought peculiar
to G or to L or to M are not mere accidents in those MSS., but
go back to some more primitive source. It must be remembered,
however, that Bentley's (or Gronovius') notes are not a collation.
Where they are fullest they are only excerptS, and neither Bentley
nor Gronovius was in a position to determine exactly what excerpts
would be most useful to-day to critics studying the interrelation of
MSS. in accordance with principles which were not fully under—
stood until Lachmann.

In speaking of these four lost MSS., I have already done some·
thing towards classifying certain others of the Codices Deteriores.
Ι append now a provisional Stemma Codicmn Manilianorum
Omnium. Ι would emphasize its provisional character, and will
try to explain briefly the principles which have guided me to
