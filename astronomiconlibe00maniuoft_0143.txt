ASTRONOMICON II

Balance? [Moreover, we must follow a briefer way of
reason through the signs] For all the stars which shine
fixed in heaven under human forms are still the foes and
the conquerors of the beasts.

None the less individual signs follow diverse private
moods of their own, and wage wars of their own with
secret enemies. Those born under the Ram have war
with those born under the Maid, the Balance, the Twins,
and those sprung from the Urn of the Water-carrier.
Men born under the Crab war with the offspring of the
Bull, and so too those born under the Claws and the
offspring of the fierce Scorpion and the Fishes. Those
whose nativity the stars of the Twins shape——these have
war with the Ram and his triangle. Upon those born
under the Crab the offspring of Capricorn work havoc, and
so too do the family of the Balance and those that belong
unto the Maid and those that are assigned to the constella-
tion of the averse Bull. The fierce Lion has the same foes
as the Ram: and the same signs levy war upon both.
Erigone fears the Crab and the double sign Archer-Centaur,
ancl the Fishes †and thee, cold Capricorn†. The Balance
has the greatest number of enemies—they are Capricorn
⁴ and Cancer, directly opposite to Capricorn, and both the
squares which belong to the Clam, and the signs that are
reckoned to the triangle of the Ram. The Scorpion is
held to be prolific of an equal number of foes3 he flees
from the Water-carrier, the Twins, the Bull, the Lion, the
Maid‚ and the Balance: and by all these is he himselffeared.
Those that are born of the constellation of the Archer—
upon them the offspring of the Twins and of the Balance
and of the Maid and of the Urn are fain to press hard,
for the very law of their nature bids them. <The signs,
again, which threaten the sign of the Bull> these in like
manner are accounted hostile to thee and thine‚ Capricorn.
Those whom the &Vates-carrier drenches with his ever-
flowing waters‚ them the Lion goads into battle, he and all
his triangle: but, before the valour of that one lad, Lion
and triangle are but a rout of wild beasts. Those born
of the Fishes are attacked by the Water-carrier‚ by the
