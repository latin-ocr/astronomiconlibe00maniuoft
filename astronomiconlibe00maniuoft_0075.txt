MANILIUS AND HIS EDITORS

shedding its dews upon the round world, swiftly speeding through
all things, and fashioning the body of things to breathing life.’¹
This God, again, who pervades all the phenomena of nature, this
Reason that makes the world one, dwells also in man. It is just
because he does so that astrology exists at all. ‘God hath de-
scended into man, and in man's seeking of him seeks himsels.'²
Nay, man is a part of God—he seeks the heavens whence he
came:

Quis caelum posset nisi caeli munere nosse

et reperire deum nisi qui pars ipse deorum est?³

These ideas are, of course, the commonplaces of Stoicism. But
they are commonplaces which Manilius touches to fine issues.
They have as he utters them the note of a personal religion. As
we read them it is impossible for us any longer to think of
Manilius and his friends as ‘the devotees of a dying superstition ’.
Far rather we must conceive of them as students who, amid the dis-
orders of a corrupt society, in the collapse of religion and morals‚
sought to turn the eyes of men to the contemplation of what they
believed to be the law and harmony and order of a divine reason.
Kant, finding two things in the world still for ever wonderful-
“the starry heavens above and the moral law within '—is far
uearer to Manilius than a Galeotti battening on the superstition
of kings.

It is constantly charged against Manilius that he has only the
most defective knowledge of his subject—*that by countless astro-
logical blunders he stands a convicted ‘dilettante'. This is an
opinion which is apt, I think, to take exaggerated expression.
Huet‚ who was competent in astronomy‚ accepts it as to some
extent true. He adds, however, and properly: ‘Excusandus
tamen Manilius, imo laudandus etiam, quod res Romanis auribus
inauditas primus scriptis tradere et metris quoque adstringere
instituerit. . . . Nam etsi rerum huiusmodi consultis indoctior
habendus est, at imperitis Romanis cum scriberet eruditus videri
potuit' (p. 86). We cannot expect a writer who deals in a com—
pletely untried material to stand wholly above the limitations of his
surroundings. Amid the general ignorance of his contemporaries
he is left without a tradition, and to a great extent without a
standard, and cannot possibly attain that exactitude which is bred
in an environment of discussion and criticism. Errors which
