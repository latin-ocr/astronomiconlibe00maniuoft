COMMENTARY 49-63

49 sqq. Cf. Georg. iii. im'l.; Nemes. Cyn. z'm‘t.; Aetna init. For
coincidences between Aetna and Manilius see Breiter‘s note here.
Breiter supposes much of the Aetna to be a criticism of Manilius, e. g.
225-50-—a suggestion which has little value.

doctae: with a touch of contempt.

52. nota: here i. q. trita.

53. rorantis prata per herbas: cf. Lucr. v. 461 gemmantis rore
per herbas. It seems unnecessary to take prata per together as = per
prata, though Manilius is fond of bold anastrophe: e. g. 905 medium
post astra diem (where, however, see Ellis) ; iii. 521 numerari signa
per horas. See Housman on i. 245, where true examples are mingled
with spurious. At Stat. Theb. viii. 654 lacrimasque in lumina fudit
the construction is clearly lumina fudit in lacrimas.

55. There is plainly some personal reference here, which we cannot
recover (Stoeber). The uolucres durato ore are perhaps such poets
as Gratius ancl Macer. Cf. Persius Prol. 12—14 :

quod si dolosi spes refulserit nummi,
coruos poetas et poelrz'das picas
cantare credas Pegaseium nectar.

Is ‘ ipse . . . Phoebus ' Augustus?

57. ora: Bentley's orsa is hardly necessary; but of the passages
cited by Breiter only iv. 441 nec parua est gralia nostri oris is relevant.
Bitterauf compares i. 113; ii. 49-55‚ 137—403 iii. 1 sqq„ 26-30.

58. opus: apparently ‘original workmanship’ ; i. q. proprium opus
Ovid Asel. ii. 5 materiem superabat opus (‘the craftsman’s skill');
‘ My verse shall be my own, not stol’n but wrought ’ (Creech).

59. propria rate: priua rate of inferior codd. Hor. Epist. i. 1. 93
locuples quem ducit priua triremis.

60 sqq. Cf. i. 247 sqq.; v. 864 sqq. (where at 890 read spiritus et
tolum ratioque infusa gubernent). Loquitur autem ex mente
Stoicorum, Du F ay. Ex mente Posidonii eiusque uerbis, thinks
Breiter. Aen. vi. 724 sqq. (Bonineontrius), where the same doctrine
fincls expression, has been likewise referred back by Norden to
Posidonius—as though, outside Posidonius, there was no Posidonian
doctrine or phraseology. who shall say how many influences meet in
Wordsworth’s

‘I have felt
A presence that disturbs me with the joy
Of elevated thoughts, a sense sublime
Of something far more deeply interfused,
VVhose dwelling is the light of setting suns
And the round ocean and the living air
And the blue sky, and in the mind of man,
A motion and a spirit that impels
All thinking things, all objects of all thought,
And rolls through all things'?

And why should we narrowly confine the spirit of Vergil or of
Manilius?

63. mundum: rou κόσμον. For the Stoica} uses of mundus, κόσμος
—all of which are found in Manilius-cfi Diog. vii. 137—8 λέγουσι δέ
κόσμον τριχῶς, αὐτόν τε τὸν θεὸν τὸν ἐκ τῆς πάσης οὐσίας ἷδὶως ποιόν, ὃς δέ
ἄφθαρτός ἐστι καὶ ἀγένητος, δημιουργὸς ὢν τῆς διακοσμήσεως . . . καὶ αὐτὴν
δέ τὴν διακόσμησιν τῶν ἀστέρων κόσμον εἶναι λέγουσι καὶ τρίτον τὸ ξυνεστη-
κὸς ἐξ ἀμφοῖν.
