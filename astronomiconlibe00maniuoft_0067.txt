MANILIUS AND HIS EDITORS

‘star' of Angustus ; Libra was the ‘star’ of Tiberius ς therefore,
when Manilius praises Libra, Angustus is dead. Now

(1) It is not certain that Libra was the ‘star' ofTiberius.

(2) It is possible that both Capricorn and Libra were the
‘snus’ of Augustus, Capricorn the star of his conception, Libra
of his birth: see Commentary on ΙΙ. 507. Turn, then, to IV.
203-16: there Libra is described as the source of order,
mensure, law, and justice, and the passage concludes:

denique in ambiguo fuerit quodcumque locatum
et rectoris egens, dirimerit examina Librae.
Is this an apology to Augustus for the
hinc et mobilitas rerum, mutataque saepe
mens natat,
which occurs in the description, just noticed, of Capricom
(IV. 256-7)? Does Manilius mean to say that, whatever is
anbrgmme in Capricorn = Augustus, is set right in Libra
= Augustus, and therefore does not matter? Or does he mean
to say that the faults of Augustus no longer matter since we now
live under the virtues os Libra = Tiberius ?
, 111 this same description of Libra we are told (IV. 21 1) that he
that is born under that sign
et licitum sciet et uetitum quae poena sequatur.
The last ποι-(15, if we are looking for a ‘spice of truth and
ρει-9011311151, ² might be a veiled satirical reference to the system of
delatio inaugurated by Tiberius. On the other hand, 1fT1benus was
likely to look in Manilius' description of Libra for a pomait of
himself, this satire would perhaps not have been sufficiently veiled.

Π. 772-7· helps us but little, for the text of 776 is un-
cerum, even if the line is not wholly spurious. (With Mr.
Housman-'s emendation, Augustus, surely, would far more fitly
than Tiberius be termed the second founder of Rome: and,
indeed, we are told by Suetonius (apud Seruium Aen. i. 292, Georg.
iii. 27) that Augustus at one time had thoughts of assuming the
name Quirinus.)

The view that Tiberius was pn'nceps when Book IV was written
finds its strongffit support in 764-6, where the island of Rhodes
(in which Tiberius spent some gloomy years) is described as

hospitium recturi principis orbem,
tumque domus uere Solis, cui tota sacrata est,
cum caperet lumen magni sub Caesare mundi.
