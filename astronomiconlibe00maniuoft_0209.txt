COMMENTARY 361— 5

cf. on 274 sqq. Finally Breiter adopts into the text the one thing in the

MS. tradition which' 1s certainly corrupt, per talis: for (1) pet g( elis 15

3 very obvious attempt to correct pmedales— we can see the beginnings

of the attempt in L' s predales— and (2) toli‘s such’ is meaningles s;
‘’such as what?

Jacob’ sper tzlis . . . limosis open to much the same objections as
Breiter’ 5 text.

Ellis follows ‘ Molinius ’ (he should have said Dulcinius and Aldus)
in reading per calles form mtur. ..limos But Bentley’s objection‚
Dic modo uerum, 1111 ips( 1 sidera formantur per tales li,neas seems to
me final. Bentley and Housman agree in regarding praedales (per
talis) as the seat of the οοιτιιρῐίοηῠ- though Bentley also alters to
for matus. Both of them, however, emend without much regard for
palaeographical probability though Housman’ 5 praeteriens is so far
right as that a pres. pte. act. is wanted. My praecludens will give the
same sense as his praetert'e’m3 cf. 376 singulo transeat. The line of
the hexagon praecludit singula, it passes by those signs which are
not alterna.

362. deuertitur‚ ‘turns in at‚' as a traveller turns in at 3 dener-
sorzum.

363. in orbem : as 154 uariantur in orbem, ‘ right round the Circle.’

365. scorpion: the Greek form is found with this word also
at i. 268, ii. 499, 502, 513, iv. 217; is Ovidian (Asel. ii. 833 Fast.
iv. 1643 Hal. 116), and is used several times by Germanicus; see
Neue-Wagner Formenlehre i. 206. Similar Greek accusatives in
Manilius are Arcton i. 564; Delon iv. 635; horoscopon iii. 190, 205,
538; Rhodon iv. 637. The Greek nominative §emptos seems
indicated in our MSS. seven times as against twelve examples of
Scorpius. 1 have ventured to write Scorpios throughout this book.

it is difficult to believe that at iv. 678 Manilius wrote Maeotisque (gen.)
lacus. M has salens there. Read perhaps M leot nsque Sandone).
At 11. 740 it is just possible that Manilius actually 1ν101011οἅ61α1111111ν1ᾋ11
but the suggestion, though it has the authority of Bentley (and though
the form might perhaps be defended from Livy xxxviii. 13. 11
(1''';ordzntzchos Pliny NH. iv. 12 ,20 Crznnletopon)‚ is, Ithink, not
very plausible. Manilius professes a genuine reluctance to eniploy
Greek terms—iii. 40-2, ἰν. 433-44 (at iv. 432—4 read faeiem mutare
loquendi, intulimus (incidimus codd.) si uerba, nget); and he certainly
avoids certain Greek names employed in astronomy by other Latin
