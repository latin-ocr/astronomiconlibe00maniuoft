INTRODUCTION I

down to three: GLM. Of these the oldest is perhaps G, though
recently Traube¹ (with hesitation) and Thielscher (with confidence)
have claimed a superior antiquity for L. G owes its notation to
the monastery of Gembloux, where it was at one time lodged:
‘the most sovran copy of Gemblau', Bentley calls it.² It
belongs now to the Bibliotheque Royale in Brussels (10012), and is
assigned to the eleventh century. A very inaccurate collation
of it made by Jacobus Susius, was sent by Gifanius to Scaliger,
who used it for his second editi0n³ (1600). G had been
employed by Carrio, who tried to pass off some of its readings
as emendations of his own.4 Scaliger made through Lipsius
some attempt to obtain Carrio's (ι Stellio' he calls him⁵) collation,
in order to supplement that of Susius, which he perceived to
have been carelessly made.0 The Bodleian copy of Priickner's

edition.

3 Bechert, Leipz. stud„ 1878, p. 6, says ‘third edition ⁹, but the text os
1590 was merely a reprint of that of 1577, not a new edition. It is note·
worthy that already in February, 1574 <five years before the first edition),
Gifanius had written to Scaliger from Strasburg offering to procure for him
Susius’ collation t Burmann, Sylloge, ii, p. 316. (Burmann dates this
letter as 1578, but wrongly surely: sor (1) Scaliger was at Geneva when it
was written ; (2) he is addressed init as ⁴ Professor Philosophiae '‚ a position
which he held only in 1573—4 3 (33 his Varro is referred to as though it had
appeared recently.) It would seem that when he undertook Manilius,
Scaliger's primary object was not critical. He cared nothing for G or any
other codex; but for chronology. ‘Illius opus ’, says Junius, writing to
Lipsius, ‘ est ingenio satum, labore meum. Ille coniecturis quasi divinis
usus est, ego librorum veterum ac non contemnendorum fulcris ’ ι Burmann,
Sylloge, i, p. 411, no. 377. But G was the principal cause of the second
edition. This may be seen from four letters of Scaliger—two to Casaubon,
Epist„ 1627, nos. lii and lxv, two to Lipsius t Burmann, Syll„ i, p. 242. (See
in particular Epist„ 1627, lii, p. 177 : ‘ Mitto ad te παλιγγενεσίαν Manilii nostri.
Nam certe Virbium istum Codex Gemblacensis iterum nobis excitavit.' Cf.
p. 165. ⁴ Virbius ⁷ recurs in the letters to Lipsius, loc. cit„ and again in Casau-
bon, Epist., Magdeburg, 1656, p. 233.) From the Ep. adv. Insulanum &Opusa
ναν. 380), however, it is clear that a part-cause of the second edition was
the desire to answer criticisms. In the first letter to Lipsius, Scaliger speaks
as though the preparation sor this second edition had taken but two months.
We hear again the Gaseon who read through Homer in three weeks.

⁵ Elsewhere ‘ the newt’ is called in the vernacular a ‘baboon', de Larroque,
p. 208. The charge of stellz'onalus presumably refers to Carrio’s thefts
