11 31-45 COMMENTARY

pietate: because Erigone = Virgo = Iustitia: see iv. 337, where
read qua custodito ( fastidito MSS.) concessa est iure poliri (cf. Germ.
Arat. 134), Hyginus ii. 4. 25 ; Fab. 1302 224 (Bunte).

32. Nepam: the Scorpion3 ictu: because he slew Orion; Hyginus
ii. 34, p. 37. 7 (Bunte). · . ..

( sp)0110: quod ab Hercule spoliatus est, HyglnuS ιι. 24, p. 66. :al-3
Bunte .

33. morsu: the bite inflicted on the foot of Heracles when he was
slaying the Hydra; Hyginus ii. 23.

Cythereide uersa: seeiv.800-1 3 Hyginus ii. 30. The connexion
with the Euphrates seems to point to a Chaldean origin sor this myth.

34. dueentem sidera: as i. 262 princeps Aries.

uicto . . . ponto: see iv. 747 sqq.‚ v. 303 alibi, Hyginus ii. 20.

39. ritus pastorum : so Bentley for ritus pecorum or pecorum ritus
of the MSS„ cf. Sil. Ital. vii. 27—ss ritusque ducis. pecorum ritus
(1) has rather the appearance of a mere attempt to emend ritus
pecorum; and (2) it should, as Bentley says, naturally mean uitam et
uictum pecudum3 so Claudian 'm‘ Cons. Han. 15 3—4 iura perosus ad
priscos pecudum damnaret saecula rz'tus; Prud. Symm. i. 80 pecudes
inter ritusque ferinos (cited by Bentley).

39—40. sonantem in calamos: Ovid Met. xi. 161 calamis agrestibus
insonat3 and probably Man.’s phrase is merely a variety for insonare
calamis (dat). Such an expression as i. 341 nutantis in radios is
hardly parallel, and should rather be compared with Verg. Georg. iii.
2 323 Aen. xii. 104 irasci in cornua ; Stat. leeb. moriuntur in iras.

Sicula tellure creatus ε Theocritus. The appropriateness of the
selection of Theocritus in this place is not obvious. Homer is men-
tioned as the father of all poetry3 but all the other references· save
this to Theocritus— are to didactic poets. Theocritus is perhaps used
merely to illustrate the fact that poetry can adapt itself to any kind of
theme, however prosaic (siluestre) or difficult.

Creech’s rendering is worth quoting:

The sweet Theocritus with sostest strains
Makes piping Pan delight Sicilian swains:
Thro’ his smooth reed no rustic numbers move,
But all is tenderness and all is love,

As if the Muses sate in every vale,

Inspired the song and told the melting tale.

nec siluis siluestre: for siluestre in a disparaging sense cp. Calp.
Ecl. iv. 12—1 3 siluestre licet uideatur aculis auribus 3 for the repetition
ib. ix. 8 pueris iam non puerilia.

41. motus: as Verg. Georg. i. 350 del molus z'ncomposz't053 Hor. Od.
iii. 6. 21.

42. arua : auras MSS. ; so aruis and auris are confused at Avien.
A rat. 38.

43-5. alius . . . ille . . . hic. The reference is said by Scaliger and
editors generally to be to such poets as Gratius Faliscus (43) and
Aemilius Macer (44-5). For Gratius see Ovid Pont. iv. 16. 34.
Macer is mentioned by Ovid at Trist. iv. 10. 43—4 saepe suas uolucres
legit milti grandior aeuo, quaeque nocet serpens, quae niret herba,
M‘acer (Macer's Thersaca and Ornz'tlzogom'a). Similarly the author of
the Preface to the second book of Cato's Disticha : quodsi mage nosse
laboras herbarum uires, Macer haec tibi carmina dicit (3—4). The
lines in Codex T uricensis 78 cited by Baehrens, Pref. to Sammonicus,
