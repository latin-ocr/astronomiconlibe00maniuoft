PREFACE

If he had said plainly that he had brought Cosmos out of
Chaos it would not have been far from the truth.

The second part of my Appendix does not pretend, any
more than the first, to be exhaustive. The editors whom
Ι ha've cited most often are naturally Scaliger and Bentley.
These two names are so important in the history of the
text that an editor owes it to his readers to cite rather
freely the emendations which attach to them, even
when these are not prima facie particularly attractive.
From other editors or annotators Ι have cited sparingly.
Ι have occasionally noticed in my Commentary suggestions
to which, sor reasons of economy‚ Ι have not given a place
in the AppendiX. Ι had at one time designed an Appendix
-somewhat on the model of the second volume of 'Weck-
lein’s Aeschylus—which should include all the emendations
known to me. But an Apparatus ought to be—-as Ι
reflected—a study in the pathology of a text, and not a
study in the pathology of editors.

1 have spoken elsewhere (Introduction, pp. lxxv sqq.) of
my obligations to works dealing specifically with Manilius,
and have attempted some estimate of those works. Ι must
here mention one or two books which deal with the sub-
ject of Astrology in general, to which Ι am conscious of
a debt. Indispensable to every student of Manilius is
Bouche-Leclercq’s L'Astrologz'c grecque (Paris, 1899), and
the use that Ι have made of this learned and well-written
book will be everywhere easily traceable. Indispensable
also is Boll's Sphaera (Leipsic, 1903)—less readable than
Bouche-Leclercq and (outside Book V) less helpsul for the
special end of Manilian study, but containing a wealth of
valuable material not elsewhere accessible. The more I
study Manilius, however, the more I feel that both these
writers are unduly severe upon his shortcomings. My debt
to Boll extends also to the Astrological Catalogne of Boll
and Cumont. Of Cornewall Lewis' Astronomy os tlze
Ancz'ents I have not been able to make much use. It is
necessarily of little service to the astrologer, and though
it is praised by Ellis, it is, I think, on the whole a work
