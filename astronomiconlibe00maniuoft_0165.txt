ASTRONOMICON 11

warfare whereof the weapons are the viewless missiles of
disease: and whether it be God or Chance that employs
here his double power, directing this way and that at will
either influence, who may say? That starry region that comes
after the Midday, where the height of heaven first begins to
slope downward and the sky falls away from its summit-—
this region Phoebus loves. By his grace is it that our
bodies here lay aside their ills, and conceive happiness out
of his strength. Therefore is this region called in the Greek
tongue ‘the God '. Opposite to this shines that region of
the universe which is the first to rise from the lowest depth
and which brings back the sky to us. Sombre is its light,
it governs our dying, and it knows for its mistress Phoebe,
Phoebe that beholds the light of her brother's realm flashed
upon her from the opposed part of heaven, [Phoebe‚ that
with the waning edges of her orb is an image of our dying
life]. This region is called in Latin speech ‘ the Goddess!
The Greeks have given it the same title in their own tongue.
But in the citadel of the sky, where the upward heights
end and the downward slopes begin, where the summit
rises equidistant from the Setting and the Rising Heaven,
and holds poised in its balance the whole universe—here

she sets her face to be as it were the countenance of heaven.
And to this region belongs that power whereby she sways
human affairs. It governs marriages and bridal chambers
and nuptial torches. This region is it that teaches love to
order its legions in the fight. Fortune is its name. From
the name know the character of the region. Even so shall
my poem, albeit long, find swift ways through difficult
themes.

Where the world sinks at the foundations of heaven and
lost in midnight beholds above it the opposed sky‚—that is
the region wherein Saturn exercises his strength. Of old
was he himself cast down from the Empire of heaven and
the seat of the gods. As father he bears influence over the
haps that befall fathers and over the fortunes of them that
are old. He hath a separate guardianship of each class
