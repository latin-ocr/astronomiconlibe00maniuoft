INTRODUCTION II

‘Vossianus tertius '. Letter xviii of Bentley throws a fuller light
on the Codex Pithoei. The facts seem to be these. Sherburne
had lent to Bentley his collation of Codex Pithoei sor Book I, or
rather his copy of Pithou's collation. Pithou's collation (not
Pithou’s MS.) was in Bernard’s possession. It was a collation in
‘a printed edition (he, sc. Sherburne‚ thinks Scaliger's in quarto)
with those variations in it manu Pitlzoest (p. 37). Now in the
Bodleian Library (Lim. D. 5. 13) there is a copy of Scaliger's
second edition (Leyden, 1600) which once belonged to Pierre
Pithou. On the front page is written ιΡ. Pithoei Luyerii ’. The
volume contains a collation of some unnarned MS.‚ and at the
foot of p. 131 there is a subscriptio: ‘collatus cum MS.‚ Calendis
Iuliis MDcxm. Tricassib. Pithou.’ MDcxm is clearly a blunder
for MDxuic, for Pithou died in 1596.¹ (The fact that this colla-
tion was made at Troyes (Tricassibus)—where Pithon was born
and where he retired to die—makes it likely that the MS. was his
private property.)2 This Bodleian collation may be supposed,
I think, to be the same as that used by Bernard, Sherburne‚ and
Bentley. The affinity of Pithoeanus with other MSS. is easily
discerned. The Codex Cusanus (a copy, probably of L) omits
III. 188, IV. 235, 312, 746. All these verses are omitted also by
the Codex Marcianus 3 but in Marcianus (which has been revised
with some MS. of the M family) they are all added in the margin,
with the exception of IV. 312. Now the Codex Pithoeanus
contained all these verses in its text save IV. 312. The same is
true of Vat. 5160, Pal. Par. Monam All five MSS„ therefore,
may be regarded as descendants of the Codex Marcianus tinctured
in varying degrees with the Λ] tradition. It was not worth my
while to examine the readings of the Pithoeanus throughout. But

¹ Strangely enough, Pithon makes a similar blunder in an Antwerp edition
(1567) os Maximianus mentioned by Ellis, C. R, 1901, p. 369 b: ‘contuli
cum MS. Puteanorum fratrum Lutetiae MDcx1 Kal. Sep. Petrus Pithoeus!
Scaliger, Epist„ 1627, p. 158, mentions Pithou's death as occurring in
November, 1596.

² P. Pithon seems to have had a MS. of Manilius in his possession in 1573.
Tamizey de Lan-oque in his Lettres smnfmses z'nddites de ‚Ioseph Scaliger
(Paris, 1881) publishes two letters of Scaliger (iii-iv, pp. 21 and 26), dated
1573, to P. Pithon, in which Scaliger says that he learns from Francois
Pithon that Pierre has an ancient MS. of Manilius. He asks for the loan of
this. But 1 cannot anywhere find that he received it. The Latin letters to
Pithon in the 1627 edition contain no reference to Manilius at all.
