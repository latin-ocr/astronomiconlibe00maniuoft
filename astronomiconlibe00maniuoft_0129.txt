ASTRONOMICON II

hundred its fifth part, for the square subtract from the same
number its tenth part. So do you get a true apportion-
ment. And thus for all the signs which the quadrangle
touches with ever-favouring aspect, and for all those points
which the line of the Circle traverses in its threefold course,
after it leaves by a straight path the trodden devious path
of the circumference, for all these Nature has established
a covenant and a law in common and mutual sympathy
and rights of friendship one with another. And so not
every triangular nativity has affinity with the signs of its
triangle‚ nor do signs which happen to be quadrangular
necessarily on that account preserve community of interests.
For it makes a difference whether the line exhaust the
proper tale of degrees or refuse the full number which the
Zodiac contains; or, again, issue in lines, now three, now
four, which logie, as may happen, compels to continue
themselves into more signs than are allowed for in the
Zodiac by the number of its degrees. But the influence
which radiates through the signs of a triangle is far greater
than that which resides in those signs which, from their
position as fourth signs to one another, are called square.
The line of the square is higher, its compass further
⁴ removed from earth. The line of the triangles travels
nearer to us and is more remote from heaven: their vision
ranges nearer earth and sends down to our air the infection
of theirs.

Between alternate signs, furthermore, there subsists but
doubtful friendship, nor do they hold fast in enduring concord
the tie that binds each to each. For the line that traverses
them is carried round reluctant in cramped circuit. One
line is formed in such a way that it passes by the unalternate
constellations while its angle enters in at alternate signs.
The line winds with six bends round the circle. From the
Bull it travels to the Crab, then traversing the Maid enters
Scorpion: anon it touches thee, cold Capricorn‚ and after
thee the Fishes and the stars of the Bull averse; and so
ends its circle whence it began. The track of the other
line is through the signs which the first omitted. A circle
is formed like to the previous one, with the same number
of angles, but so formed that you omit, in following it,
